  <h3><strong>Richard Bacon MP's statement to the Planning Inquiry into the proposed windfarm at Bussey's Loke, Hempnall</strong></h3>
  <hr size="1" id="line"><br>
  <p class="newsbody"><img src="/images/RB_R.jpg" name="LHpic" width="200" id="LHpic">Thank you for providing me with this opportunity to speak  and for your flexibility on the date and time. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">It will be well known to all the parties to this appeal that  on 23 October 2013 TCI Renewables Ltd lodged an appeal with the Secretary of  State for Communities and Local Government on the grounds of South Norfolk  Council’s failure to give notice of its decision within the appropriate  period. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">It will also be well known that, on Wednesday 29 January  2014 members of the Development Management Committee of South Norfolk Council  voted 10-1 to determine that the council would have refused planning permission  for this application had they been able to determine the application in the  normal manner absent TCI Renewables’ appeal to the Secretary of State.  </p>
  <p class="newsbody">As all parties to this appeal will be aware of these  developments, I do not wish to go into great detail on the chain of events leading  up to this inquiry.  Rather, I want to  emphasise:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="newsbody">First, the need to heed the clearly expressed views of the  people of Hempnall; <br></li>
   <br> <li class="newsbody"> Second, why planning decisions taken locally should not  automatically be overridden by national policy objectives at appeal; and </li><br>
       <br><li class="newsbody">Third, how the Secretary of State’s decision to recover this  appeal demonstrates clearly the weight he gives to the views of local people. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="newsbody">The people of Hempnall have had this matter hanging over  them for almost six years, starting with Enertrag UK Ltd’s initial application for  a seven-turbine windfarm in April 2008 through to the new site owners TCI  Renewables’ appeal on the grounds of non-determination in October 2013.  I have great admiration for the resilience shown  by the people of Hempnall in ensuring that their voice is heard.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Following TCI Renewables’ application for planning  permission for four turbines at Hempnall in January 2013, Hempnall residents  have gone to extraordinary lengths to make their views clear and unambiguous.  On 18 March 2013, a Parish Poll conducted by  South Norfolk Council at the request of Hempnall Parish Council asked  residents:</p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin:0px 15px 0px 15px"><em> <a name="Q1"></a>“Do you support the planning application (SNC Ref 2013/0105)  by Streetwood Wind Farm Norfolk Limited (Agent’s name: TCI Renewables Limited)  for the erection of 4 wind turbines in Hempnall?” [<a href="#1" class="newsbody_link">1</a>]
  </em></p>
  <br>
  <p class="newsbody">The residents of Hempnall rejected TCI Renewables’ proposal  by a margin of four to one.  Half of the  residents voted in the poll and 80 per cent of those taking part voted  ‘No’.     </p>
  <p class="newsbody">In September 2013, TCI Renewables amended its application by  removing turbine T2.  Given the change in  the application, Hempnall Parish Council decided to consult residents once  again.  On 21 October 2013, South Norfolk  Council conducted a second Parish Poll which asked:</p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin:0px 15px 0px 15px"><em> <a name="Q2"></a>“Do you support the planning application (SNC Ref 2013/0105  as amended) by Streetwood Wind Farm, Norfolk Limited (Agents name: TCI  Renewables Limited) for the erection of 3 wind turbines in Hempnall?” [<a href="#2" class="newsbody_link">2</a>]</em> </p>
  <br>
  <p class="newsbody">The residents of Hempnall again voted emphatically to reject  TCI Renewables’ amended proposal, this time by 82 per cent.  </p>
  <p class="newsbody">It may be argued that the expression of local views  contained in these polls does not represent a planning ground upon which this  appeal should be dismissed.  However, such  grounds absolutely do exist and in my 1 October 2013 submission to South  Norfolk Council, I laid out my concerns that these proposals would be in breach  of directives contained within paragraphs 98, 118 and 133 of the National  Planning Policy Framework; Policy 1 of the Greater Norwich Development  Partnership’s Joint Core Strategy; and South Norfolk Council planning policies  ENV8 and UTL13.   </p>
  <p class="newsbody">It is deleterious for the health of our democracy and the  concept of localism if planning decisions taken locally are subsequently  overridden by national policy objectives at appeal.  The whole purpose of the Localism Act is to:</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin:0px 15px 0px 15px"><em> <a name="Q3"></a>“…devolve more powers to councils and neighbourhoods and  give local communities greater control over local decisions like housing and planning.”  [<a href="#3" class="newsbody_link">3</a>]</em></p>
<br>
  <p class="newsbody">Therefore, to reject the unambiguous and strengthening views  of Hempnall residents expressed twice over at the ballot box would be to  misread the clear intent of this Government to place greater emphasis on local  decision making on planning matters.  It  would also place insufficient weight on the importance of listening to local  views.  </p>
  <p class="newsbody">On 27 March 2013, the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced  the final abolition of England’s Regional Spatial Strategies, saying that:</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin:0px 15px 0px 15px"><em><a name="Q4"></a>“This government is committed to localism and greater local  decision-making in planning. The flawed top-down targets of regional planning,  centrally imposing development upon communities, built nothing but resentment.”  [<a href="#4" class="newsbody_link">4</a>]</em></p>
<br>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Pickles understands the bitterness that can be caused  when local views are overridden by national targets and policies at appeal, a  point he made again in a Written Ministerial Statement on 6 June 2013, saying  that:</p>
  <p class="newsbody_quote"><a name="Q5"></a>“…planning works best when communities themselves have the  opportunity to influence the decisions that affect their lives.  However, current planning decisions on  onshore wind are not always reflecting a locally led planning system.” [<a href="#5" class="newsbody_link">5</a>]</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Pickles’ statement went on to promise new planning  guidance to assist local councils and planning inspectors in their  consideration of individual planning applications, which would set out clearly  that:</p>
  <p class="newsbody_quote"><a name="Q6"></a>“…the need for renewable energy does not automatically  override environmental protections and the planning concerns of local  communities” [<a href="#6" class="newsbody_link">6</a>]</p>
  <p class="newsbody">That planning practice guidance was published by the  Department for Communities and Local Government in July 2013, and states that:</p>
  <p class="newsbody_quote"><a name="Q7"></a>“… all communities have a responsibility to help increase  the use and supply of green energy, but this does not mean that the need for  renewable energy automatically overrides environmental protections and the  planning concerns of local communities.  As  with other types of development, it is important that the planning concerns of  local communities are properly heard in matters that directly affect them.”  </p>
  <p class="newsbody">And that:</p>
  <p class="newsbody_quote">“The views of local communities likely to be affected should  be listened to.” [<a href="#7" class="newsbody_link">7</a>]</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Since the publication of this guidance, the Department for  Communities and Local Government has continued to insist upon the importance of  local views.   Responding to a debate on  Planning Policy and Wind Turbines on 12 March 2014, DCLG minister Kris Hopkins  told MPs that:</p>
  <p class="newsbody_quote"><a name="Q8"></a>“We are determined to give communities a greater say over  the proposals that affect them.” [<a href="#8" class="newsbody_link">8</a>]</p>
  <p class="newsbody">You will be aware of Mr Hopkins’ subsequent letter to me  dated 14 March 2014 in which he confirms that this appeal will be recovered by  the Secretary of State for his own determination.  </p>
  <p class="newsbody">The Minister also makes it clear he understands the strength  and depth of local feeling, citing a total of 1,185 letters of objection to  both iterations of these proposals as evidence of local opposition.  Mr Hopkins makes it abundantly clear that this  strength of local feeling means, inter alia, that this appeal warrants  recovery.   This is surely proof enough  of the Government’s determination to ensure that local voices are heard in  planning matters.  </p>
  <p class="newsbody">In conclusion, the direction of travel of the Government’s  policy indicates clearly that the planning system is intended to empower  communities, through democratically elected councillors, to decide for  themselves how their area should develop. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Whilst national policies and guidance have a place, this  government does not believe that such policies should always trump other  considerations and it has therefore been staunch in redressing the balance in  favour of local views.  I am in total  agreement with this view.</p>
  <span class="newsbody"><br clear="all">
  </span>
  <p class="newsbody">The vast majority of the residents of Hempnall have indicated  very clearly indeed that they do not want this wind farm and I have laid out in  detail the Government’s view that local people should be listened to.  I therefore respectfully ask that you  recommend to the Secretary of State that this appeal be dismissed.  </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Thank you very much.</p>
