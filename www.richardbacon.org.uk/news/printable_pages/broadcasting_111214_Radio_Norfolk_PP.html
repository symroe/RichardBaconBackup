<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK	MP Richard Bacon has called on the BBC Trust  to think again over plans which risk weakening the links between BBC Local  Radio stations and the communities they serve.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon made the call in a letter to Lord Patten, Chairman  of the BBC Trust, regarding proposed changes to  local radio services as  part of the BBC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Delivering Quality First&rsquo; plans.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The proposals  suggest that local early morning, mid-afternoon and evening radio shows are  replaced by regional or England-wide programmes.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;According to RAJAR, BBC Radio Norfolk is  the most popular station in this county after Radio 2 and the fifth most  popular BBC Local radio station in England.&nbsp; However, the BBC is proposing  changes to its local radio stations, including replacing some Norfolk shows  with regional or England-wide programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;I am concerned that these plans fail to appreciate that  people listen to local radio because they want to hear about the places they  live from people who live in them too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Listeners to BBC Radio  Norfolk don&rsquo;t tune in to hear about Nottingham, Northampton or Newcastle, and  I&rsquo;m sure the reverse is also true.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;The BBC&rsquo;s proposals risk putting the link between Radio  Norfolk and its listeners in jeopardy.&nbsp; If BBC Radio Norfolk stops talking  to Norfolk about Norfolk, then it may struggle to keep its loyal  listeners.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have written to Lord Patten outlining the risk that  these proposals will undermine a real community asset&rdquo;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">The BBC Trust, the body which oversees the BBC, is  consulting on these proposals until 21 December 2011.&nbsp; Listeners can  respond by going to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/consult/local_radio.shtml" class="tsb">BBC Trust website</a> and clicking on &lsquo;Tell Us What You Think&rsquo;.</p>
