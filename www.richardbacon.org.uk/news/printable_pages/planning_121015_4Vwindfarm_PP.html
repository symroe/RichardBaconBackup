<p class="newsbody"><img src="/images/RB_R.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="262" id="RHpic">Speaking after the Planning Inspectorate dismissed TCI  Renewables&rsquo; appeal to overturn South Norfolk Council&rsquo;s rejection of a three  turbine windfarm on land between Dickleburgh, Rushall and the Pulhams, South  Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said:</p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;This decision is a  victory for common sense. The Planning Inspector has clearly listened to strongly  expressed local views and I am particularly pleased that she has recognised  that the turbines&rsquo; impact on the gentle rural landscape in Rushall would be  significant and harmful.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;St Mary&rsquo;s Church in  Rushall would have been overwhelmed by these turbines, and some residents would  have had no escape from turbines towering over their homes. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;<strong>South Norfolk  Council was right to reject these plans and the formidable 4 Villages campaign  group has worked extremely hard to protect local residents and see off these  proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their key concerns have  now been endorsed by the Planning Inspector.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;In order to take  proper advantage of the benefits of wind power we should continue to go  off-shore, where it is much windier.&nbsp;It would then be possible to have  large scale developments and big economies of scale, without the intrusion  which this type of development on-shore will inevitably cause in a gentle rural  landscape&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking after Planning Inspector Ms Zoe Hill today  dismissed TCI Renewables&rsquo; appeal against South Norfolk District Council&rsquo;s  decision to refuse planning permission for three 126-metre turbines on land  between Rushall, Dickleburgh and the Pulhams</p>
