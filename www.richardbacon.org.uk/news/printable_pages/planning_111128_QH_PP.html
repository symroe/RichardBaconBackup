<h3 class="bigword4">MP wants action to end Queen&rsquo;s Hills deadlock</h3>
<p class="newsbody"><img src="/images/rb_stern.jpg" alt="" id="LHpic">SOUTH NORFOLK  MP Richard Bacon has written to the administrators  for a defunct development company to demand an explanation for the hold-ups  preventing vital infrastructure improvements on the Queen&rsquo;s Hills development  on the outskirts of Norwich.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon took action after being informed by South Norfolk  Council that a deal to deliver long-awaited infrastructure and community facilities  brokered between Edinburgh-based administrators Deloitte, the house builders on  Queen&rsquo;s Hills and the Council looked set to collapse.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;I am very disappointed that yet another attempt to  break the deadlock on Queen&rsquo;s Hills is on the brink of failure.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;A lot has been going  on behind the scenes.&nbsp; Most recently, the  house builders on Queen&rsquo;s Hills asked South Norfolk Council to release them  from some of their legal obligations.&nbsp; The  Council was prepared to accept this on the basis that the developers provided  an agreed &pound;675,000 for the long awaited community centre by the end of  September, but legal wrangles involving Deloitte appear to have stymied the  deal.&nbsp; Two deadlines have now come and  gone without any progress.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;South Norfolk  Council has bent over backwards in order to get infrastructure and community  facilities delivered to Queen&rsquo;s Hills.&nbsp; The  horse-trading has gone on long enough.&nbsp;  It is time for action and I want to hear from Deloitte how they are  going to end this deadlock once and for all&rdquo;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
