<h3 class="bigword4">Local MP helps keep Victory Academy open during strike action</h3>
<p class="newsbody"><img src="/images/RB_OVA_3.jpg" alt="" id="LHpic" title="Photo copyright: Ormiston Victory Academy">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon turned his hand to teaching on 30 November 2011 by supporting Ormiston Victory Academy in  Costessey, near Norwich, during  nationwide industrial action by teachers.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was asked to help by the Academy&rsquo;s Principal,  Rachel de Souza, who was singled out for praise by the Norfolk MP for her  determination to keep Victory Academy open &lsquo;whatever it takes&rsquo; during strike  action.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> Victory Academy, which was  launched in 2010, recorded the biggest improvement of any school in the country  when GCSE results were released in Summer 2011.&nbsp;  Named after the flagship HMS Victory which was commanded by Norfolk&rsquo;s  most famous son, Admiral Lord Nelson, the Academy is organised into four  colleges &ndash; Endeavour, Courage, Discovery and Enterprise &ndash; and expects high  standards and commitment from its students.</p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;I am  a great admirer of Rachel de Souza and all she is doing for students in the  Costessey area.&nbsp; Victory Academy has  already made tremendous improvements since its launch last year and we cannot not  afford to see progress disrupted.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;I was  glad to help on what was potentially a difficult day for the Academy  and for many other schools across the country.  <strong>We cannot afford to  put students&rsquo; education in jeopardy, no matter how strongly some teachers may  feel about the present dispute.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong>Whatever  the nature of the disagreement, the students in our schools have no part in it.&nbsp; They do not deserve to have their education  put at risk by irresponsible and thoughtless strike action.&nbsp; Those teachers and headteachers who worked hard to keep schools open on Wednesday deserve our warm thanks&rdquo;.</strong></p>
