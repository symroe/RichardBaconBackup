<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the publication of the review into the East of  England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) by Dr Anthony Marsh, Chief Executive of  the West Midlands Ambulance Service Trust, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said:</p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;I welcome Dr Marsh&rsquo;s  thorough and candid report, which shows how the East of England Ambulance Trust  has been allowed to degenerate into a well-funded basket case.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Rather than take  swift and decisive action, the Board has been caught in a spiral of paralysis  and decline.&nbsp; There are many superb staff  working for the Ambulance Trust and they deserve better leadership than  this.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Trust&rsquo;s own turnaround  plan, announced to much fanfare earlier this year, has become three different  plans which do not fit together. </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;It is appalling that  the Trust doesn&rsquo;t appear to know for sure either how many frontline staff it  actually employs or how many it will need . The Trust also needs to re-think  the bizarre notion that what it needs right now is to recruit &pound;350,000 worth of  non-operational staff.&nbsp; With around 400  front-line vacancies, there must be better ways to spend this money.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;I do not believe the  Trust Board has the ability to drive through Dr Marsh&rsquo;s recommendations in an  robust, effective manner.&nbsp; I have  therefore written to the Health Secretary to urge him to deploy a  transformational turnaround team to see the Trust through this difficult  period&rdquo;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
