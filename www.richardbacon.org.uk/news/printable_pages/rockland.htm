		Rockland St 
		Mary Primary School</div>

<p class="newsbody"><b>SOUTH Norfolk MP Richard Bacon officially opened the new extension to Rockland St Mary Primary School on Saturday 25 September. 
</b> 

			<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">According to records at County Hall, there has been a school on the site since the 1840s. 
					
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">A new school was built in the 1880s from bricks that were baked in Rockland St Mary. 
		

		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">Hand-baked bricks from Suffolk have been used in the new extension.
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"><b>Mr Bacon said: 
		&quot;I was delighted to see how the original character of the Victorian building has been maintained with attention to detail and by using local building materials. This has created a wonderful atmosphere within the school which will benefit all who work in it&quot;.</b><p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align: justify">The extension, which was started in March and completed in time for the autumn term, provides extra classroom space, a school office and staffroom as well as a private office for headteacher Ken Holbeck. The children also have a playing field and hard court area for play and organised games.
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align: justify">The official opening was coupled with the school's annual fete which, this year, had a circus theme. The children entered into the spirit of the event turning up dressed as animals, clowns, fortune teller and even the big top.
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon said: 
		&quot;It is always a pleasure to visit Rockland St Mary Primary School. Ken Holbeck is an excellent and committed headteacher which is proved by the splendid Keystage 2 Test results achieved last term and the happy faces of the children, staff and parents&quot;.</b><p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align: justify">&nbsp;<table width="100%"><tr><td><a class="tsb" href="javascript:printWindow()">Print This Page</a>
