<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has urged a planning inspector to dismiss the appeal against South Norfolk Council's refusal of planning permission for a three-turbine windfarm between Dickleburgh, Rushall, Pulham Market and Pulham St Mary.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Addressing the planning inquiry into the proposals, Mr Bacon said that the Government is an enthusiastic supporter of renewable energy schemes in  appropriate locations, but that in this case the  public interest would best be served by protecting local amenities from the  proposed development.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold"> Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;All  the relevant planning policy guidance states clearly that development,  including renewable energy schemes,&nbsp; should only be permitted where the  impact that they will inevitably create is considered to be acceptable.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;If the impacts of such schemes are not considered to be acceptable then the  guidance is clear: they should be refused.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;The damaging trend towards  central control will be reversed and top-down targets and requirements will  go. This means that developers will be expected to  provide communities with a much clearer understanding of the <em>direct</em> benefits they will receive from development and it will be for communities to  decide for themselves whether those benefits are worth the impact on their  locality. </p>
<p class="newsbold"><span class="newsbody">Mr Bacon also told the inquiry that he supported the decision of South Norfolk Council to reject planning permission for the proposed scheme.</span></p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon added: &ldquo;The decision of South Norfolk Council to reject  this proposal was taken with clear regard for, and in accordance with, all  relevant Government policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;It is therefore my view that that the appeal  should be dismissed.&rdquo; </p>
