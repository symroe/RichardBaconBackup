<p class="bigword3">Bacon joins Skills Minister in praising Saffron apprenticeship scheme</p>
<p class="newsbody">South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon has joined Skills  Minister Matthew Hancock on a visit to  Saffron  Housing Trust in Long Stratton to find out more about their innovative apprenticeship scheme. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Saffron&rsquo;s  scheme enables the fusion of small businesses and 20 young apprentices from the  Diss area of South Norfolk. </p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon, a supporter of Saffron&rsquo;s apprenticeship programme said: &ldquo;I am delighted that the Minister is visiting  Saffron Housing today to see how the Trust&rsquo;s apprenticeship scheme is  pioneering a new relationship between business, schools and the voluntary  sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="newsbody">The apprenticeship scheme was first discussed by Saffron&rsquo;s Board in  January 2011.. Under the scheme, Saffron will employ 20 young apprentices, who  will then work with small businesses in South Norfolk, thus removing the  paperwork and administration which often deters small businesses from taking  this next step.&nbsp; Saffron will continue to  provide support and mentoring during the apprenticeship programme, drawing on  their considerable experience with their &lsquo;in-house&rsquo; apprentices as well as  providing financial support to the scheme.</p>
<p class="newsbold"> Mr Bacon added: &ldquo;By taking on the administration of an apprenticeship, Saffron is  freeing up local business from much of the day to day hassle involved in taking  on an apprentice.&nbsp; The Minister&rsquo;s visit  to Saffron is sending a powerful signal to local firms that this scheme means  business&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Stuart Tinkler,  Assistant Director at Saffron Housing said: &ldquo;We employ apprentices ourselves  and know how important it is to grow tomorrow&rsquo;s workforce but we also know how  daunting it can be for local businesses to take on their first apprentice. We  feel that both businesses and residents within our local community will benefit  from this innovative scheme&rdquo;. </p>
<p class="newsbody">It can be particularly  challenging for young people to find employment opportunities within a rural  community and Diss High School recognises that a range of routes into  employment is required by its pupils. As the apprentices will be local to the  Diss area their training, which will be provided by BCTS, will be delivered at  the school&rsquo;s facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbold">One of the  first local businesses to express an interest is the award winning Pennoyer  Centre in Pulham St Mary.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a  social enterprise and still quite young&rdquo; commented Sheila Moss-King, Chair of  Trustees at The Pennoyer Centre &ldquo;so taking on an additional staff member is a  big step.&nbsp; Because Saffron will help us  to recruit the right young person and offer support, we feel this is a great  opportunity for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="newsbold">Stuart  Tinkler of Saffron added &ldquo;This Saffron scheme brings together several elements  of the Saffron community and will help small businesses by providing an  opportunity to pass on skills and knowledge whilst adding to their workforce.&nbsp; By engaging with a school that already recognises  the needs of this particular group and a training provider with considerable  experience, we hope that Saffron can further help our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="newsbold">On hearing more of the Saffron scheme and having the  opportunity to meet some of Saffron&rsquo;s existing apprentices, Skills Minister  Matthew Hancock MP, said: &ldquo;I am very much looking forward to  seeing Saffron&rsquo;s innovative approach to boosting apprenticeships in Diss and  meeting some of the young people who are&nbsp;already benefiting  from&nbsp;their in-house apprenticeship scheme. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;Apprenticeships help businesses to prosper and compete, while  also giving young people the opportunity to carve out their career and gain  invaluable skills and experience.&quot; </p>
