<p class="bigword4">MP applauds DCLG action on Upper Vaunces Farm </p>
<br>
<p class="newsbody">MINISTERS AT the Department for Communities and Local  Government (DCLG) have confirmed that the  final decision on a three turbine windfarm on agricultural land near Rushall  will be taken by the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Following South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon&rsquo;s strong  representations to DCLG on behalf of local residents, Planning Minister Kris  Hopkins confirmed in a letter to Mr Bacon that the appeal would be recovered by  his department.&nbsp; This means that the final decision on the windfarm will  be taken by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rather than a planning inspector.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Although the planning inquiry on  the proposed wind farm concluded in January, Section 79 of the Town and Country  Planning Act 1990 empowers the Secretary of State to recover a planning appeal  for his own determination at any point up until an inspector issues a  decision.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said today: &ldquo;I am very pleased that Mr Hopkins  has recovered this appeal so that Eric Pickles can take the final  decision.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;It is bad for democracy if planning decisions taken  locally are overridden by national policies at appeal.&nbsp; The whole purpose  of localism is to put give local communities greater control over local  decisions like housing and planning.&nbsp; Eric Pickles can look at these  issues in the round and come to a balanced conclusion that gives proper weight to  local views&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><span class="newsbody">TCI Renewables had already appealed to the Planning  Inspectorate on the grounds that South Norfolk Council had taken too long to  reach a decision on its application.</span>&nbsp; </p>
