<h3 class="bigword4">MP  signs Motor Neurone Disease charter</h3>
<p class="newsbody">South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon has signed the Motor Neurone  Disease (MND) Association's Charter in recognition of the rights and priorities  of people living with MND and their carers.</p>
<p class="newsbody">MND kills five people every day, with half of people dying  with 14 months of diagnosis.&nbsp; This  terminal disease can affect any adult at any age.&nbsp; There is no known cure.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Unfortunately, this condition is still little understood and  this contributes to many people with MND not receiving the care and support  they need. The MND Charter has been launched with the aim to change this.&nbsp; The five-point charter sets out what good  care looks like for people with MND and their carers and is designed to raise  awareness and understanding of this devastating disease.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;Motor  Neurone Disease is a deadly, debilitating condition but people who suffer from  MND should not have to forfeit their dignity and quality of life to this  disease. &nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am delighted to  sign up to the <a href="http://www.mndassociation.org/get-involved/campaigning-influencing/MND+Charter" class="newsbody_link"><strong>MND Charter</strong></a>.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Liam Dwyer, a person  living with MND and fronting this year's MND awareness campaign said:&nbsp; &ldquo;Many people with MND die without having the  right care, not having a suitable wheelchair, not having the support to communicate.  When living with MND, one month waiting for an assessment or a piece of  equipment is like a year in most people's lives, especially as half of the  people with MND, die within 14 months of diagnosis.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">The MND Charter, which has already received endorsements  from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) aims to ensure people  with MND and their carers have access to timely and appropriate information,  care, services that allow them to maximise their quality of life and ensure  they are treated with dignity.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Farah Nazeer,  Director of External Affairs at the MND Association said: &ldquo;What matters most is  that people with MND and their carers can access the right care, in the right  place and at the right time.&nbsp; We need to  ensure that the needs of people with MND and the priorities for good care&nbsp; as set out in our charter are recognised and  respected. We urge everyone to sign the charter to show their support&rdquo;.</strong></p>
