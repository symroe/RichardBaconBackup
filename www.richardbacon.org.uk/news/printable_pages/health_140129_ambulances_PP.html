<h3>Ambulance Trust improving but has much still to do, says MP</h3>
<br>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has welcomed a new report into the East of England Ambulance Service but has said that much remains to be done to get the Trust back on track.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking following the publication of a report by the Care  Quality Commission (CQC) into its unannounced inspection of the East of  England Ambulance Service NHS Trust,.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: <strong>&ldquo;This is an encouraging  report, although the CQC is clear that much remains to be done to get our  ambulance service back on track.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;I welcome Dr Marsh&rsquo;s  determination to sort out the deep-seated problems at our ambulance service  and, as the author of the report that originally exposed the Trust&rsquo;s failings,  he is very well placed to know what needs to be done to improve matters&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">The CQC's report finds that: &#8220;After careful consideration, we have concluded that the trust is taking reasonable steps to 
  address the breaches in regulations and therefore it would not be appropriate to take 
  further enforcement action at this point. </p>
<p class="newsbody">&#8220;However as the impact for people waiting to be transported to hospital remains as a moderate concern, we have escalated our concerns to the Trust Development Authority who have the responsibility to support the trust in taking the necessary action to improve its service. We will continue to closely monitor the 
  trust, inspecting it as required and working with NHS England to review its progress&#8221;.</p>
