<p class="bigword3">Bacon praises Saffron Aprenticeship scheme</p>
<p class="newsbody">South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon has praised Saffron Housing  Trust&rsquo;s &pound;90,000 investment&nbsp; in an innovative new  apprenticeships project. &nbsp;20 local  businesses will be given the ability to take on their first apprentice next  year under Saffron&rsquo;s Apprenticeship Programme.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;This programme is very good news indeed.&nbsp; By taking on the administration of an  apprenticeship, Saffron Housing Trust, and its partners are freeing up local  businesses from much of the day-to-day worry involved in taking on  apprentices.&nbsp; This is exactly the sort of  innovative approach the economy needs.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;This is a simple, common sense idea with real potential and I salute  Saffron and its partners Robert Ashton, BCTS, and Diss High School, for  launching this excellent scheme&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking after Saffron Housing Trust announced  a &pound;90,000 investment in a 20-place Apprenticeship Programme.&nbsp; Under the scheme, Saffron will recruit and  employ up to 20 apprentices and &lsquo;contract out&rsquo; the apprentices to local  businesses, while providing full HR support and training throughout the length  of the apprenticeship. Local businesses will have an apprentice working with  them four days a week with the remaining day spent off-site studying.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The programme is a partnership between Saffron Housing  Trust, Broadland Council Training Services (BCTS), Diss High School and Author  and Social Entrepreneur Robert Ashton. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Saffron will be launching the new apprenticeship programme  at Diss High School at the end of October to current Year 11 students.</p>
<p><span class="newsbody">If you run a local business in South Norfolk and would like  more information on the apprenticeship programme, please contact John  Whitelock, Saffron Director of New Business on 01508 532046 or email him at </span><a href="mailto:jwhitelock@saffronhousing.co.uk" class="tsb">jwhitelock@saffronhousing.co.uk</a>. </p>
