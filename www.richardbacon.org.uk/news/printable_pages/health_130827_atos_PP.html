<h3>MP calls on DWP to ensure Atos centres are accessible </h3>
<br>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has urged the Department for  Work and Pensions to ensure that Atos Healthcare&rsquo;s Medical Assessment Centres are  accessible to wheelchair users and people with limited mobility. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon took action after being contacted by Mark Harrison,  CEO of South-Norfolk based charity Equal Lives regarding the accessibility of  the Norwich Assessment Centre, which is on the second floor of St Mary&rsquo;s House  on Duke Street.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;Norwich is the only  Atos office in East Anglia without any provision for medical assessments at  ground level. </strong><br>
    <strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
    <strong>&ldquo;Given that Atos is  carrying out disability assessments for the DWP, one would have thought that  Atos would have realised the importance of making its premises accessible to  disabled people.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;I raised this matter  with the DWP but unfortunately the reply I received rather missed the point,  which is not whether there is a lift or whether people can be sent to accessible  centres as far away as Nottingham.&nbsp; The  point is that Atos did not give enough thought to the accessibility needs of  wheelchair users and people with limited mobility when it rented its Norwich  offices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;I have urged the DWP  to instruct Atos to ensure all of its Medical Assessment Centres are either  located at ground level or have provision to hold assessments on the ground  floor&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">Atos has seven Medical Assessment Centres in East  Anglia:&nbsp;<br clear="all">
</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li class="newsbody">Cambridge;</li>
    <li class="newsbody">Chelmsford; </li>
    <li class="newsbody">Colchester; </li>
    <li class="newsbody">Ipswich; </li>
    <li class="newsbody">King&rsquo;s Lynn; </li>
    <li class="newsbody">Norwich; and </li>
    <li class="newsbody">Peterborough.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="newsbody">Of these seven, five are on the ground floor except  Cambridge and Norwich.&nbsp; However, Atos&rsquo;s  Cambridge centre has one assessment room on the ground floor.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The Luton assessment centre is on the sixth floor without  any provision on the ground floor.&nbsp; </p>
