<h3>Common sense prevails over Norwich disability assessment centre, says MP</h3>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has said that &ldquo;common sense  has prevailed&rdquo; after ministers confirmed that they will now look to move Norwich&rsquo;s disability  assessment centre out of a building with no disabled access. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking after Mike Penning, Minister for Disabled  People announced that the Department for Work  and Pensions (DWP) would look to exit St Mary&rsquo;s House in Duke Street, Norwich  as soon as possible.&nbsp; Atos Healthcare  conducts disability assessments for the DWP on the second floor  of St Mary's House with no disabled  access.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, along with disability campaigners, the Norwich Evening  News and fellow Norfolk MPs Chloe Smith and Simon Wright, had been calling on the Department for Work and Pensions to review its choice of St  Mary&rsquo;s House for the Norwich assessment centre.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said today: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very good news that the DWP will now look to end its use of St Mary&rsquo;s House for disability assessments.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&quot;The Minister is very sensible and it only took one look for him to realise that the situation at St Mary&rsquo;s House was unacceptable,  and had to be fixed.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;Whoever decided originally  that St Mary&rsquo;s House was an appropriate venue for disability assessments really shouldn&rsquo;t be involved in government  anymore.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&quot;Thankfully, common sense has now prevailed&rdquo;.</strong></p>
