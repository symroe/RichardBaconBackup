		<p class="newsbody">An MP today welcomed the  announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the Norwich Research Park  will share in &pound;100 million of investment in science and research  facilities.&nbsp; The Park includes the John  Innes Centre, one of the world&rsquo;s leading centres for research in the biological  sciences.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody">South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon  said: </p>
		<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Norfolk MPs have made the case to ministers for the  economic growth prospects offered by the county&rsquo;s internationally renowned  cluster of scientific expertise around the Norwich Research Park.&nbsp; I am  very pleased that the government has listened.</strong></p>
		<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;I am delighted that the work of the scientists at the  Norwich Research Park has been recognised by the Government.&nbsp; The Park  includes the John Innes Centre, one of the world&rsquo;s leading centres of  excellence in biological sciences which by itself contributes over &pound;170 million  a year to the UK economy.&nbsp; </strong></p>
		<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Also based at the  Research Park is the Sainsbury Laboratory, internationally renowned for its  excellence in the fields of plant and microbial sciences, and the Genome  Analysis Centre, which is using its ground-breaking work in genomics technology  to tackle global problems in agriculture, sustainable energy, food and  nutrition.&nbsp; </strong></p>
		<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Norwich Research Park&rsquo;s cutting edge work helps to  secure Britain&rsquo;s place as a world-leader in scientific research, which is vital  to our future economic success. This welcome investment will help the Research  Park to realise its future plans and strengthen Norfolk&rsquo;s growing reputation as  a dynamic county that can deliver the growth which the economy needs&rdquo;.&nbsp; </strong></p>

        <p class="artsub"><strong><em>About the  Norwich Research Park:</em></strong></p>
        <p class="edirots">Europe's centre for research in health, food and environmental  sciences, the Norwich Research Park is a collaboration  between&nbsp;the&nbsp;University of  East Anglia, the Norfolk and Norwich University  Hospitals, and four  independent research centres; the John Innes  Centre, the Institute of Food Research, the Sainsbury Laboratory&nbsp;and from July 2009&nbsp;The Genome Analysis Centre.&nbsp; The Norwich Research Park&nbsp;is  home to over 30 science and IT based&nbsp;companies making the NRP a vibrant place to do  business as well as research.</p>
        <p class="edirots"> With over 11,000 people the Norwich  Research Park has one of Europe&rsquo;s largest single-site concentrations of  research in Health, Food and Environmental Sciences. We are internationally  recognised for the excellence of our research in the plant and microbial sciences, food, health, environmental sciences, computer and information systems and chemistry. An analysis of the most highly cited  scientists in the UK over the past 20 years&nbsp;reveals that Norwich is ranked  4th after London, Cambridge and Oxford (New Scientist, 1 July 2006/Thomson  ISI).</p>
        <span class="edirots">JIC is an  independent, international centre of excellence in plant science and  microbiology. Our mission is to carry out fundamental and strategic research,  to train scientists and to make our findings available to society.
        </p>
        </span>
  <p class="edirots">The scientific  research at the Centre makes use of a wide range of disciplines in the  biological and chemical sciences, including cell biology, biochemistry,  chemistry, genetics, molecular biology, computational and mathematical biology. </p>
        <p class="edirots">The John Innes  Centre is a registered charity (No. 223852) and a company limited by guarantee  (registered in England No. 511709). </p>
        <p class="edirots">The JIC is an  institute of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(BBSRC).</p>
        <p class="edirots">The JIC leases the  extensive land and buildings it uses from the John Innes  Foundation, an independent  charity (registered charity No. 313462) that was formed in 1910 following a  bequest from Mr John Innes.</p>
        <p class="edirots">The vast majority  of our funding is won, in open competition, from various funding agencies in  the UK and worldwide. We are currently supported by over 40 different  organisations. The Centre is grant-aided by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences  Research Council (BBSRC). </p>
        <p class="edirots"> The Centre is  co-located with these other separate organisations: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li class="edirots">The Sainsbury Laboratory; founded in       1989 on the JIC site as a joint venture between the Gatsby Charitable       Foundation, the University of East Anglia, the BBSRC and JIF. The       laboratory has a worldwide reputation for its research in molecular plant       pathology and genetics. Although an independent laboratory it is       scientifically, physically and administratively linked to JIC. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li class="edirots">Plant Bioscience Limited (PBL);       established in 1994 by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the John Innes       Centre with BBSRC as a key shareholder, it is a leading independent IP       management and technology transfer company managing a broad portfolio of       life sciences, with particular strengths in plants and microbial science.       It handles technology emerging from many laboratories across UK and indeed       worldwide including most of the JIC's and SL's technology transfer.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li class="edirots">The       Norwich BioIncubator;       20,000 sq. feet of state-of-the-art laboratory and office facilities,       backed by expert support and advice, to provide an innovative and       stimulating environment where entrepreneurs and companies can develop       their ideas and technologies. </li>
          <span class="edirots"><br>
          </span>
          <li class="edirots">The       Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC); a national BBSRC Centre created in partnership with East of       England Development Agency (EEDA), Norfolk County Council, Norwich City       Council, South Norfolk Council and the Greater Norwich Development       Partnership. The Centre analyses plant, animal and microbial genomes, and       provides genome sequencing to underpin scientific advances. It is a centre       of excellence in bioinformatics and ensures that the data generated by its       genome analysis, and that of other facilities, can be effectively       collected and analysed.</li>
