<h3>MP calls for lower speed limit at Loddon</h3>
<br>
<p class="newsbody">
  <img src="/images/130920_A146_RBRB.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="415" id="LHpic" text="Nine year old Reece Bayliss hands Mr Bacon his road traffic survey and questionnaire">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard  Bacon has called on Norfolk County Council to lower the speed limit on the A146  as it passes Loddon from 60 miles per hour to 40 miles per hour.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon made the call after  visiting the A146 with Loddon residents Reece Bayliss and Richard Wharton, who  both contacted their local MP to draw his attention to the speed of traffic on  the A146, which runs from Norwich to Lowestoft. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Nine year-old Reece has  conducted both a study of the traffic on the A146 and a survey of local views  on what should be done to improve things.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;The speed  limit for traffic passing Loddon on the A146 is quite unsuitable and I have now  seen for myself how lorries and cars tear past the turnings into the village at  terrific speeds.&nbsp; Crossing the A146 on foot is very dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;People using the junctions  into the town from the A146 are being placed in unnecessary jeopardy.&nbsp;  Residents at least are aware of the potential dangers but, as Loddon sits at  the gateway to the Norfolk Broads, there are also going to be plenty of  tourists coming here who don&rsquo;t know the road.&nbsp; There have been a stream of  serious accidents including some fatalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very grateful to  Reece for his hard work in surveying the traffic and for taking the time to  find out what his fellow residents want to do about it.&nbsp; I have asked the  County Council to look seriously at cutting the speed limit on the A146 where  it passes Loddon to 40 miles per hour&rdquo;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
