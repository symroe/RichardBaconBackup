			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify"><br>The Rt Hon Lord Adonis<br>
		Secretary of State<br>Department for 
		Transport<br>Great Minster House<br>76 Marsham Street<br>LONDON&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SW1P 4DR&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">29 January 2010</p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">Dear
			<span class="CharChar">Lord Adonis</span></p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="text-transform: uppercase"><font face="Verdana"><b>greater anglia rail franchise</b></font></span></p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">We are writing with 
		regard to your recent decision not to renew National Express East 
		Anglia&#8217;s franchise, which was announced in the House of Lords on 1 
		December 2009. &nbsp;</p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">We welcome your 
		decision not to renew National Express East Anglia&#8217;s franchise for a 
		further three years.&nbsp; Passenger Focus&#8217;s Spring 2009 TOC report into 
		National Express East Anglia (NXEA) perhaps explains why few tears have 
		been shed over this decision locally.&nbsp; The TOC report finds that over 
		half of NXEA&#8217;s passengers did not believe they got value for money for 
		the price of their ticket and a majority of passengers are also not 
		happy with the availability of NXEA staff, standards of cleanliness and 
		the competence with which NXEA tackles delays.&nbsp; Many local residents, 
		particularly those who regularly travel to London, were also dismayed 
		that NXEA ceased to provide a restaurant car and closed its 
		Norwich-based call centre.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">Your department will 
		soon be seeking fresh bids from Train Operating Companies for the 
		Greater Anglia rail franchise. Before any decision on the new franchise 
		holder is taken, it seems to us that this would be an appropriate moment 
		to reassess the needs of Norfolk residents with regard to the 
		specification for the Greater Anglia franchise. &nbsp;</p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">Norfolk is a dynamic 
		county and a centre of excellence in science, engineering, finance and 
		the creative industries.&nbsp; A number of internationally-renowned research 
		organisations call Norfolk their home and the John Innes Centre, the 
		Institute of Food Research, the Sainsbury Laboratory&nbsp;and the new&nbsp;Genome 
		Analysis Centre&nbsp;together form the largest concentration of food and 
		plant scientists in Europe.&nbsp; Norfolk engineering companies trade around 
		the world with organisations like Airbus, NASA and Toyota, and Lotus are 
		driving forward the next generation of high-performance cars.&nbsp;&nbsp; After 
		two centuries, Norwich remains a major centre for the financial 
		industries, with over 50 national, international and regional companies 
		based here and the county is also a major centre for the creative 
		industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time NXEA&#8217;s franchise expires on 31 March 2011, the 
		population of Norfolk is projected to grow by 5.3 per cent, or 44,100 
		people.&nbsp; The government expects that, as a minimum, over 62,000 new 
		houses will be built in the county by 2021 and many of the county&#8217;s 
		residents to be will want to make use of the rail network for business 
		or leisure purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">However, Norfolk 
		already has a growing appetite for rail travel.&nbsp; Norfolk&#8217;s 31 railway 
		stations were used by over 7.1 million people in 2007-08, up by a 
		quarter on 2006-07.&nbsp; On average, Norfolk&#8217;s stations saw a 43 per cent 
		increase in usage between 2006-07 and 2007-08, greater than in 
		comparable counties such as Suffolk, Devon, Northumberland and 
		Lincolnshire.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">Services to London 
		comprise 76.8 per cent of all journeys to or from the East of England 
		and four out of the five most widely used stations in the county &#8211; 
		Norwich,&nbsp;King&#8217;s Lynn, Diss and Downham Market &#8211; have direct services to 
		London.&nbsp; Indeed, in 2007-08 the usage of Diss station increased by 32 
		per cent, the largest growth in usage for any station on the Norwich to 
		London Liverpool Street line.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">The world class 
		businesses choosing Norfolk as their base will inevitably need to use 
		the rail network to connect them with the capital and other parts of the 
		country.&nbsp; Passenger journeys within the East of England have more than 
		doubled in the last decade.&nbsp; A better rail service is good for Norfolk 
		and good for the wider economy.&nbsp; However, this growth cannot be 
		sustained without the appropriate rail services in place.&nbsp; Sadly, NXEA 
		has proved itself to be incapable of meeting this rising demand and the 
		Passenger Focus TOC report notes that satisfaction over the frequency of 
		trains has fallen consistently and markedly since Autumn 2007.&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">In 2008-09, National 
		Express East Anglia paid £98 million to the Exchequer, which represents 
		a cost of 2.5 pence per passenger kilometre and is the third highest 
		subsidy in Great Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, NXEA is responsible for the 
		terms of its original bid, but the level of subsidy payments has 
		nonetheless made it difficult for significant investments in services to 
		be made beyond cosmetic changes to rolling stock and rebranding 
		exercises.&nbsp; Whilst the temptation for the Treasury may well be to 
		maximise return from the franchise, National Express&#8217;s rail operations 
		should provide a cautionary tale.&nbsp; The company promised huge premium 
		payments in order to win franchises but simply could not make good on 
		its undertakings and the quality of National Express services suffered.&nbsp; 
		The size of the premium offered by TOCs to the Exchequer must never be 
		put before the quality of the service offered to passengers and we would 
		ask that this be central to government thinking when the new franchise 
		is awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">A new franchise must 
		also mandate a higher quality of travel experience than has thus far 
		been the case.&nbsp; For example, many TOCs offer free wi-fi access and 
		laptop power points but NXEA has declined to offer either of these 
		services.&nbsp; Indeed, NXEA has seemed rather more interested in withdrawing 
		onboard services to passengers, rather than offering new ones.&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">We echo the six 
		priorities expressed by Shaping Norfolk&#8217;s Future, whose partners in a 
		campaign for improvements include the East of England Development 
		Agency, Regional Cities East, the Norfolk Rail Alliance, Norfolk County 
		Council and the Norfolk Chamber of Commerce:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="artlist" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15.0pt">Faster journey times<br><br>
				</li>
			  <li class="artlist" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15.0pt">More carriage capacity<br><br></li>
				<li class="artlist" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15.0pt">Investment in track infrastructure to enable faster and more reliable 
		journeys<br><br></li>
				<li class="artlist" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15.0pt">Retention 
		and development of a high quality intercity service offering an 
		excellent travel experience on clean, comfortable, wi-fi enabled trains, 
		including good catering facilities<br><br></li>
				<li class="artlist" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15.0pt">Improved 
		station environment and facilities<br><br></li>
				<li class="artlist" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15.0pt">Longer 
		franchises which can further increase investment in the service<br></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">We welcome your 
		statement this month favouring longer franchises for the future and 
		trust that such a model will be considered for application to the 
		Norwich-London line.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">Furthermore, we 
		strongly believe you should consider action to secure:</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li class="artlist" style="margin-left: 15pt; text-align: justify">Good 
		weekend services<br><br></li>
				<li class="artlist" style="margin-left: 15.0pt; text-align: justify;>Effective 
		ticketing, marketing and customer information</span></p></li>
			<li class="artlist >Investment in new engines<br><br></li>
				<li class="artlist" style="margin-left: 15.0pt; text-align: justify">Options 
		for local services out of Norwich for leisure travellers and commuters, 
		building partnerships to do so if appropriate<br><br></li>
				<li class="artlist" style="margin-left: 15.0pt;text-align: justify">Extension 
		the franchise definition to include Norwich-Peterborough (which overlaps 
		to Ely with Norwich-Cambridge)<br><br></li>
				<li class="artlist" style="margin-left: 15.0pt; text-align: justify">Modernisation of line and stations throughout the region and including 
		other key interchanges such as at Stratford and Stansted </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">We recognise the role 
		of Network Rail in achieving these ends, and acknowledge that a 
		considerable element of the responsibility for current poor service 
		rests with Network Rail&#8217;s performance in East Anglia.&nbsp; Reviewing the 
		work of Network Rail alongside the re-franchising process is central to 
		securing a better service and gaining effective infrastructure 
		investment. </p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">To conclude, Norfolk 
		deserves a better railway link than it currently has.&nbsp; The appetite is 
		there for a better rail network now and it can only get stronger.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p class="artlist" style="text-align: justify">We would welcome your 
		assurance that the specification for the new franchise will take the 
		above points into account.&nbsp; Your colleague Chris Mole MP has already 
		indicated willingness to meet Norfolk MPs at the end of the 
		consultation.&nbsp; We look forward to discussing the above issues with your 
		team then.</p>
