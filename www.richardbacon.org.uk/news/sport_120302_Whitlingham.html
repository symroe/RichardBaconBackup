  <p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has praised the award of  £50,000 of Olympic legacy funding from Sport  England’s <em>Inspired Facilities </em>Fund to Whitlingham  Boathouses Foundation, and additional funding from the Thomas Cook Children’s Charity.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The <em>Inspired Facilities</em> fund is part of the £135 million <em>Places People  Play </em>legacy programme that is bringing the magic of a home Olympic and  Paralympic Games into communities across the country. Every sports facility  that receives funding will carry the London 2012 Inspire mark – celebrating the  link to the Games.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">As  part of this, the Thomas Cook Children’s Charity has awarded over £100,000 to  sports clubs and organisations around the UK in the first round of grants from  applications to the Inspired Facilities fund.&nbsp; The Charity become Sport  England’s corporate partner last year and today sees one of the first awards to  be made.</p>
  <p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon, said: “This welcome investment is great news for Whitlingham  and a worthy way of marking the 2012 Olympics.</p>
    <p class="newsbold">“The  London Games will spark fresh enthusiasm for water-borne events where Britain  traditionally does very well.&nbsp; This grant means Whitlingham will be well  placed to serve both Norfolk’s dedicated canoeists and rowers, and also a new  generation who have been inspired to get into these sports.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbold">“I  know the Boathouses will wear their ‘London 2012 Inspire’ mark with  pride.&nbsp; Well done Whitlingham.”</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Pete Constanti, Chairman of the Thomas Cook Children’s Charity  said: “We’re really pleased to award £5,000 to Whitlingham Boathouses  Foundation to help them improve their facilities.&nbsp; We’ve been overwhelmed  with the number of applications for our grants and the Fund - it really does  show that there is amazing work being done by volunteers in sports clubs up and  down the country.” </p>
  <p class="newsbody">The  project will provide the essential infrastructure for the new community boathouse  development including connection of the utilities and a disabled lift for  access to the first floor.<br>
    <br>
    Sport England’s Chair, Richard Lewis, said: “This investment will create will  be a fantastic sporting legacy for Whitlingham Boathouses.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">“This  fund has really hit the mark with sports clubs in South Norfolk. It shows we’re  offering the legacy that people want for their local community. For hundreds of  clubs and tens of thousands of people, 2012 will be the year their local sports  facilities got better.”</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Max  Heron, Trustee and Project Team Leader, said: “We are delighted to secure the  first Inspired Facilities grant, which will enable us to make a major step  forward in upgrading our community rowing and canoeing facilities at  Whitlingham. It is the cornerstone of our strategy to deliver an outstanding  new facility for everyone in Norfolk as part of the 2012 Olympics’ legacy.”</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The  project is one of 350 local community sports groups who have been offered a  total of £17.4 million in Olympic legacy funding through the <em>Inspired  Facilities </em>Fund.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The  investments announced today will breathe new life into tired facilities that  can be unattractive to sports participants, difficult to maintain and run.  Grants have also been offered to convert existing buildings into venues that  are suitable for grassroots sport and to allow local clubs to buy the  facilities they use.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Minister  for Sport and the Olympics, Hugh Robertson MP, said: “We  want to use the Olympic and Paralympics this summer to inspire a generation to  get involved in sport across the country. This is why as part of the £135  million Places People Play legacy programme we invited community sports clubs  to apply for funding to upgrade their facilities.”</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><em>Inspired  Facilities</em> has been designed to be as simple and accessible as possible for potential  applicants, with a shorter form and a catalogue of  ready-made options to choose from. This is the first of five funding  rounds of <em>Inspired Facilities</em>; the second round opened on 1 February  2012, offering hundreds more local groups the chance to bid for a further £10  million of funding.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><em>Places  People Play </em>is  being delivered by Sport England. We are working in partnership with the  British Olympic Association (BOA) and the British Paralympic Association (BPA)  with the backing of The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and  Paralympic Games (LOCOG) and the London 2012 Inspire mark.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">LOCOG  Chair, Seb Coe, said: “This is a fantastic funding project that will deliver a  real legacy from the London 2012 Games. It will provide a whole range of  sporting opportunities for young people through improved facilities and will I  hope inspire them to take up sport.”</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The announcement was welcomed by the Local Government Association.  Cllr Chris White, Chair of its Culture, Tourism and Sport Board, said: “In  spite of budget pressures, councils are striving to keep supporting local  sports clubs and want to work with them in creating a lasting and meaningful  Olympic and Paralympic legacy. This much-needed funding will hopefully act as a  catalyst to further strengthen local partnerships between councils and sports  clubs and get more people playing sport.”</p>
