		&#8220;We are delighted that Richard Bacon and Tony Wright joined us on the 
		visit with students from Norfolk. The HET&#8217;s &#8216;Lessons from Auschwitz&#8217; 
		Project is such a vital part of our work because it gives students the 
		chance to understand more the dangers and potential effects of prejudice 
		and racism today on a national and local scale.&nbsp; With the support of 
		Government funding, we are excited to be expanding the programme to 
		enable many more students to benefit from this life&#8211;changing

		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span lang="EN-US">The 
		visit was a unique opportunity to see what happened, to pay respect to 
		those who lost their lives, and to explore the universal lessons of the 
		Holocaust. The group was shown around the camp&#8217;s barracks and 
		crematoria, and witnessed the registration documents of inmates, piles 
		of hair, shoes, clothes and other items seized by the Nazis. They were 
		then taken, the short distance to Birkenau where a memorial and 
		candle-lighting service was held to remember the 6 million Jews, and the 
		Roma, Sinti, gay, disabled, black people, and other victims of the Nazis 
		killed in the Holocaust. </span></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span lang="EN-US">The

		students for the visit and to reflect on their experiences. On their 
		return, the students are required to give a presentation to their peers, 
		based on their experience of visiting Auschwitz and the lessons they 
		have learnt. In this way, as many young people as possible benefit from 
		the <i>Lessons from Auschwitz </i>Project.<i> </i>Government funding has 
		enabled the Trust to facilitate regional visits to Auschwitz, as part of 
		its<i> Lessons from Auschwitz </i>Project for thousands of students each

			<p class="bigword8" style="page-break-after: avoid; text-autospace: none"><b>The Holocaust 
			Educational Trust </b>			<div class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">The Holocaust Educational Trust was established 
			in 1988 to educate young people from every ethnic background about 
			the Holocaust and the important lessons to be learned for today. HET 
			works in schools, universities and in the community to raise 
			awareness and understanding of the Holocaust, providing teacher 
			training, an outreach programme for schools, teaching aids and 
			resource materials. HET regard one of their earliest achievements as 
			ensuring the Holocaust formed part of the National Curriculum for 
			History. HET continues to play a leading role in training teachers 
			on how best to teach the Holocaust and earlier this year, the 
			Treasury pledged a three-year commitment to enable HET to administer a broad programme 
			of teacher training.<p class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">
			<span lang="EN-gb">In November 2005, the Government announced 
			funding of £1.5 million for HET to support its <i>Lessons from 
			Auschwitz </i>Project for<i> </i>teachers and sixth form students. 
			In February 2008, the Government announced the continuation of 
			funding for the <i>Lessons from Auschwitz </i>programme for a 
			further three years from 2008 to 2011. The funding is enabling HET 
			to facilitate visits to Auschwitz for 2 sixth-form students from 
			every school and college in the UK.</span></p>
			<p class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">The Holocaust Educational Trust has produced a BAFTA 
			award-winning DVD-ROM <i>Recollections: Eyewitnesses Remember the Holocaust,</i> in conjunction with the USC Shoah Foundation 
			Institute. The groundbreaking interactive teaching resource
			integrates testimony from 18 
			eyewitnesses to the Holocaust, including Jewish survivors, Roma and 
			Sinti survivors, Jehovah&#8217;s Witness survivors and political prisoners 
			as well as testimony from survivors of the eugenics programme.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="bigword8" style="text-autospace: none"><b>Lessons from Auschwitz Project </b>
			<div class="liltext" align="justify">The Holocaust Educational 
			Trust&#8217;s <i>Lessons from Auschwitz</i> Project for teachers and 
			sixth-form students is now in its ninth year. The course is run over 
			three non-consecutive days with the focus being a one-day visit to 
			Auschwitz-Birkenau. The visits, combined with pre-and post-visit 
			seminars, leave an unforgettable emotional and educational mark on 
			participants. The Project aims to increase knowledge and 
			understanding of the Holocaust based on the premise that <i>&#8216;seeing 
			is better than hearing&#8217;</i> and to signal what can happen if 
			prejudice and racism become acceptable.<p class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">
			Since the Projects&#8217; 
			inception in 1998, HET has taken over 6,000 students and teachers to 
			Auschwitz-Birkenau, as well as many MPs and celebrities. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="bigword8" style="text-autospace: none"><b>
			Orientation Seminar</b><div class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">
			Participants are given the 
			opportunity to hear a Survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau give testimony 
			at the orientation seminar. During the seminar participants are 
			divided into small groups which are facilitated by one of our 
			educators or by a member of staff. The participants remain in these 
			groups throughout the Project. Each group discusses their reasons 
			for taking part in the Project, their expectations, preconceptions 
			and the potential impact that the visit may have on them. It also 
			provides a useful opportunity for participants to get to know each 
			other before they share what for many is a very moving and important 
			life experience.<br>
&nbsp;<p class="bigword8" style="text-autospace: none"><b>Visit to 
			Auscwitz-Birkenau</b><div class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">
			During the visit itself, 
			students are first taken to Osweicim, the small town next to 
			Auschwitz death and concentration camp where the local Jewish 
			community lived prior to the start of the Second World War. The 
			groups are then shown several barracks at Auschwitz I &#8211; registration 
			documents of inmates, piles of hair, shoes, clothes and other items 
			seized from the prisoners as they entered the camps. Participants 
			are then taken the short distance to Birkenau. This is the site that 
			most people associate with the word &#8220;Auschwitz&#8221; and where the vast 
			majority of victims were murdered. The remnants of barracks, 
			crematoria and gas chambers are in stark contrast to Auschwitz I and 
			many people feel this has a greater impact on them. The tour of 
			Birkenau culminates in a memorable service held next to the 
			destroyed crematoria II. The service includes readings, a moment of 
			reflection and ends with all participants lighting memorial candles 
			and placing them around the remains of the crematoria.</p>
			<p class="bigword8" style="text-autospace: none"><b>
			Follow-up Seminar</b><div class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">
			At the follow-up seminar 
			participants discuss the visit, their personal responses and the 
			impact it had on them. The seminar is very important for 
			participants, as often visitors to Auschwitz have a delayed reaction 
			to the experience and many find it difficult to speak to those who 
			have not been there.<p class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">
			All student participants are 
			required to disseminate what they have learned to their school and 
			wider communities. Teachers and students describe it as life 
			changing.<p class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">
