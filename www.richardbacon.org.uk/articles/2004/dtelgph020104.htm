		<p class="artsub">Politics may be about power, but power is usually 
		about money. And in politics the truth is that no amount of scheming and 
		dreaming matters very much if you don't have the cash to put your plans 
		into action.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">So 
		if Gordon Brown spends more on schools, or less on roads, it's not just 
		teachers and students who get their hopes up, nor just motorists who 
		despair. Ministers know their political futures depend on how much money 
		they receive. Spend more and you are powerful. Spend less and you are 
		weak.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		This creates a big problem, though. For a rising minister, getting 
		headlines by announcing an exciting new programme is much sexier than 
		seeing through a difficult policy and delivering results. By the time 
		people can see the results the minister will have moved on to something 
		else. </p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		It's no better for permanent officials. Sometimes they're moved even 
		more often than ministers. How do you get ahead in Whitehall? Not by 
		delivering programmes. No baby mandarin wants to spend years organising 
		benefit payments or checking hospitals are cleaned properly. The smart 
		jobs are in advising ministers and crafting policy.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		Recently, one senior civil servant, addressing a group of Norfolk 
		farmers, actually said: &quot;My job is not to deliver programmes but to 
		provide strategic input into a multiplicity of strategies.&quot; Any farmer 
		working through the night getting in the sugar beet crop would be 
		forgiven for blowing a large raspberry.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		Why is it like this? Because the skill most valued in Whitehall is the 
		ability to explain why something that looks like a disaster is in fact a 
		triumph or, at least, more than one had any right to expect in the 
		circumstances.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		And why is that? Because politicians look to civil servants to help them 
		out of tight spots - often created when they didn't pay enough attention 
		in the first place.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">A 
		recent report to Parliament from the National Audit Office* says there 
		is a risk that the extra cash going into public services will just get 
		wasted. It points out that a mere one per cent improvement in how the 
		money available is spent over the next three years would release some 
		£14.5 billion for front-line services. That's more than 4p on 
		income tax in one year.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		The trouble is that the system rewards spending money, not looking after 
		it.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		There is a black hole at the heart of British government. If taxpayers 
		knew just how big it was they would throw a fit. The public sector in 
		Britain loses billions - by my calculation between £29 billion and 
		£44 billion every year. That's £500 to £700 for every 
		man, woman and child in the country.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		Where does the money go? It's not just the familiar mantra about extra 
		special advisers in Whitehall. True, central government administration 
		costs have skyrocketed from £14.8 billion in 1997 to nearly £21 billion now. But it goes much deeper.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		The Department for Work and Pensions has received a black mark from the 
		auditors every year since 1988 because of the volume of fraud. Yet it 
		doesn't even have a target date for producing a clean set of accounts. 
		Each year, between £3 billion and £7 billion goes south 
		through fraud and error. Five years ago, civil servants running social 
		security were slammed by MPs for not knowing if housing benefit fraud 
		was going up or down. They still don't.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		There are 40 new Apache helicopters worth more than £1.2 billion 
		stored in a warehouse on Salisbury Plain, at a cost of £6 million, 
		because the Ministry of Defence didn't train enough pilots in time.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		Customs &amp; Excise loses between £7 billion and £10 billion on 
		unpaid VAT and £7 billion on excise duties on alcohol, tobacco and 
		fuel. The Inland Revenue says £2.5 billion is at risk annually 
		because of income tax self-assessment.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		Each year taxpayers spend £100 million training teachers who never 
		set foot in a classroom. Just one failed computer scheme, the Benefit 
		Payments Card, cost £1.1 billion before it was scrapped - and 
		there are many more. A computer system for the probation service had 
		seven managers in seven years, five of whom knew nothing about project 
		management. The project ran 70 per cent over budget. A computer system 
		for the magistrates' courts saw costs explode from £156 million to 
		nearly £400 million. It doesn't work properly, of course. That 
		£400 million would have paid for all the schools in Norfolk for a 
		year. The new £500 million computer for the Child Support Agency 
		(CSA) isn't working, either: that's the one which replaced the old CSA 
		computer because it was inadequate.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		The Government Communications Headquarters expected to pay £40 
		million for moving the signals intelligence computer systems into its 
		new building. Managers told the GCHQ board it would cost £20 
		million. Actually, it cost £400 million.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		The Government thinks the National Health Service loses 16 to 20 per 
		cent of its budget each year through waste, mismanagement, incompetence 
		and fraud.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		Dirty hospitals kill 5,000 people a year and cost £1 billion. That 
		would pay for policing in Norfolk for nine years.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		Clinical negligence claims cost another billion. One in five of all 
		civil servants works for the Ministry of Defence. Yes, we still live in 
		a dangerous world, but do we really need 103,000 civil servants to 
		support 189,000 military personnel?</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		The Private Finance Initiative has been a bonanza for bankers, 
		consultants and lawyers. The professional fees for Mr Brown's fancy new 
		Treasury Building, another PFI project, come to over £25 million, 
		more than one fifth of the construction cost. A leading City investment 
		banker recently told me: &quot;I like PFI. It's a good source of income. It's 
		good for the business. But as a taxpayer it really pisses me off.&quot;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		Extra money will only make a difference if two things happen. First, the 
		people running our public services need to be allowed to get on with it, 
		without constant interference. Second, the people who stump up the cash 
		through their taxes need more choice about where they get their 
		services. Patients should be able to choose which hospital they want to 
		be treated in. Parents should be able to choose which school is best for 
		their children.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">
		People don't want the state telling them what to do but to make the 
		choices themselves. Personal taxes are reaching the limits of 
		acceptability and Gordon has reached for the credit cards. But if we 
		stopped the haemorrhage of cash from our public sector we would have to 
		worry less about extra taxes and borrowing.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Mr 
		Brown is running a ghastly experiment to prove that the Nanny State from 
		1945 to 1979 would have worked just fine if only he had been running it. 
		It is doomed to failure. But it may cost us a fortune before he admits 
		it.</p>
