  <h3>It is time to make self-built homes a &#8220;mainstream part&#8221; of Britain's housing market </h3>		
  <hr color="#CCCCCC" size="1" style="margin-bottom:20px">
  <p class="bigword8"><em>South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Self-Build, Custom-Build and Independent Housebuilding will lead a House of Commons debate on the importance of the self-build and custom-build market on Wednesday 7 May.</em></p>
  <p class="bigword8"><em> Here, in an article  for the Politics Home website, Richard explains why it is so important to make self-build a mainstream part of the UK housing market...</em></p>
  <p class="newsbody">	FOR PEOPLE  who want their own home, it  should be quite normal to find a plot of land and then build a house, or to get  a builder to build one for you. And in many countries, it is indeed normal. In  Canada, Germany, France, Ireland and Sweden, self-build and custom build  accounts for over 50% of the national housing supply. In tiny Austria, it is  86%. </p>
  <p class="newsbody"> 
    In the United Kingdom it is we who are the outliers, with self-build accounting  for less than a tenth of the UK’s housing supply. Although there are many in  the UK who would like to build their own homes or commission a builder to  construct exactly what they want, the sector is still seen as an elite club  only open to the highly eccentric or extremely affluent.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> 
    The result? As the presenter of Channel Four’s <em>Grand Designs </em>Kevin  McCloud puts it: “<em>We build some of the poorest performing, most expensive  and smallest homes in Europe</em>.”</p>
<p class="newsbody"> 
    The recent Budget provides hope for a real shift in attitudes and practice. The  Chancellor has announced that £150 million will be available to help local  authorities develop 10,000 “serviced plots” - fully serviced sites where the  foundations, drainage and other utilities are pre-laid but the remainder is  left as a blank canvass, leaving people to choose for themselves what they  would like to see built. In the Netherlands, where they have done this, people  have camped out through the night for the chance to buy a plot, in a way we  only see in Britain for the January sales in Oxford Street. Nor is it only  about home ownership. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Community building groups on the Continent have shown  that this approach has considerable potential for the rented sector too. </p>
<p class="newsbody"> 
    With the right help and attitudes it can be made much easier - and empowering.  Examples from Germany include a group of older women who wanted to live  together in a block, knowing there would be plenty of friends nearby; and  parents whose children have special needs who built a small community with its  own special school. There is no good reason why self-build and custom build  cannot become a mainstream part of the UK housing market. Many of the supposed  problems are quite capable of being solved.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> 
  Some say: “Where would all the land come from?” The large volume housebuilders  have already have very considerable landbanks - but the system encourages them  to sit on these assets for decades until conditions are “right” to build and  sell a house at a profit. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold_blue"><strong>This is perfectly rational behaviour within  the confines of the current system, but it does not help the young couple in my  rural constituency who desperately want to get their own house yet who cannot  see how they will ever manage to do it. </strong></span></p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold_blue"><strong>What if it were normal for large-scale  developers to provide serviced plots to give their customers more choice? What  if local planners also saw this as normal behaviour and encouraged it? Or even  required it? </strong></span></p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold_blue"><strong>The new national planning framework does impose obligations on  local authorities to measure demand for self-build and to take steps to meet it  - but few authorities have done this yet.</strong></span><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
  Some say this approach is not “scalable” and so could never make a serious  difference to our housing crisis. Yet the failure of “targets” in the public  sector has shown us that if one concentrates on removing obstacles rather than  on obsessing about targets, it is possible to achieve performance improvements  much greater than any target one might have dared to set. Ted Stevens of the  National Self-Build Association has estimated that there are seven million  people currently researching how to build their own homes. </p>
<p class="newsbody"> 
  Quite simply, if it were easier to do self and custom build, there would be  more of it. Much more. It is perfectly possible to make self-build a mainstream  part of our housing supply, as it already is in other countries. It is time we  stopped treating self-build and custom build as an enviable dream for the lucky  few and started to make it an affordable reality open to all.
