  <h3>Giving housing customers more choice through self-build and custom-build</h3>		
  <hr color="#CCCCCC" size="1" style="margin-bottom:20px">
  <p class="bigword8"><em>South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Self-Build, Custom-Build and Independent Housebuilding will lead a House of Commons debate on the importance of the self-build and custom-build market on Wednesday 7 May.</em></p>
  <p class="bigword8"><em> Here, in an article  for the Politics Home website, Richard explains how self-build and custom-build housing can give homebuyers a real, affordable choice...</em></p><Br><hr size="1" color="#ccc" width="50%" align="center"><br>
  <p class="newsbody">What do people spend most of their money on? For nearly all of us,  whether renting or buying, the answer is where we live. And yet there is more  choice in the market for apples or for beer or even for toothpaste than there  is for housing.&nbsp; It is an extraordinary paradox that where people spend  the most money, they also have the least choice.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">This happens because of the collision of three facts. Fact One is <em>land</em>,  which is not just scarce – they have stopped making it. In order to deal with  the land problem, we have invented Fact Two, <em>planning</em>, with a plethora  of rules and regulations, thankfully slimmed down by the government but still  having to cope with the intrinsic tension between competing potential land  uses. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Fact Three is our <em>stock market</em>. The large national  housebuilders&nbsp; – having relatively easy access to large amounts of capital  &nbsp;– buy up nearly all the potential building land and then sit on it,  “landbanking” until they need it or trading it among themselves. They build  houses to a small number of standard designs that are repeated again and again  in different parts of the country.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Then there is the Conversation Problem.&nbsp; It is much easier  for the local council to talk to a small number of these large national housebuilders  – and to prise out of them a new primary school or a community hall – than to  ask for the opinions of large numbers of individuals, who elsewhere would be  known as ‘customers’. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">The result? As Kevin McCloud of Channel 4’s Grand Designs has put  it: “The consumer has been on the receiving end of a pretty poor deal. We build  some of the poorest performing, most expensive and smallest homes in Europe.  That’s not something to celebrate.” </p>
  <p class="newsbody">It could be quite different. 53 per cent of the adult population  would like to build a house at some stage in their lives. 30 per cent would  like to do it in the next five years. 14 per cent are currently researching how  and what to do and if they can finance it. More than one million people want to  buy a site and start in the next 12 months. (IPSOS MORI poll). </p>
  <p class="newsbody">There are exciting possibilities here for the whole skills agenda,  but this is not about everyone learning how to become a plumber or an  electrician. Most people would use a builder as a general contractor, if only  they could get a piece of land. In the German <em>Baugruppe</em> model,  like-minded individuals club together and build a community, including homes  for rent and for those on modest incomes.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">We have to make it easier for customers to express their choices.&nbsp;  The government has started to recognise the potential, with a £150 million  reusable fund to help develop “serviced plots”, where all the most difficult  parts – getting in the roads, sewers, electricity, gas, and water – are already  dealt with.&nbsp; This could be the new normal, if we started treating the  building of houses as if customers mattered.</p>
