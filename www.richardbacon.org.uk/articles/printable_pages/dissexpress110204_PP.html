<h3>Progress on debate over Diss roads</h3>
<p class="artsub">South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon brings <em>Diss Express</em> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> Last  week I chaired a meeting about future development at the east end of Frenze  Hall Lane, Diss. Representatives came from Persimmon Homes, Diss Town Council,  South Norfolk Council, and the County&rsquo;s highways department. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Persimmon  owns land just south of Frenze Hall Lane which it bought after outline  permission for residential use had already been granted.&nbsp; Ideally the Town  Council would like Persimmon to allow the option of linking up Vinces Road  through to Frenze Hall Lane at some time in the future, to ease pressure on  Victoria Road.&nbsp; A second problem is that draft plans show a second full  access to Persimmon&rsquo;s site through Sycamore Way, increasing traffic flows past  a children&rsquo;s play area. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Persimmon  say linking through to Vinces Road would make the site unviable. However, due  to an agreement with planners, developer money could be used to improve the  junction of Vinces Road with Victoria Road.&nbsp; Persimmon has also agreed to  restrict the link through Sycamore Way to pedestrians, cyclists and emergency vehicles  only, which is a significant improvement.</p>
<p class="bwp6">Breakfast with farmers at Goodies Farm Shop<br>
    <span class="newsbody"> I  met farmers from across East Anglia for a working breakfast at Goodies Farm  Shop to discuss the growing crisis in the pig industry.&nbsp; Pig farmers do  not get subsidies from the taxpayer but have stood on their own feet, unlike  many agricultural sectors. </span>
<p class="newsbody">That  does mean facing the full force of changes in world markets, and grain prices  have never been higher. This is great news for grain farmers but it also makes  animal feed extremely expensive.</p>
<p class="newsbody">There  are things we can do. Imported pork is still produced overseas using animal  welfare standards which would be unlawful here, so consumers can help a great  deal by avoiding foreign meat products. I have once again introduced a Food  Labelling Bill into the House of Commons to help consumers know where meat  comes from. I will also be contacting each of the major supermarkets to ask  them what steps they are taking to support British farmers. </p>
<p class="bwp6">Long Stratton Bypass<br>
    <span class="newsbody">I  met Long Stratton Parish Council to discuss the A140 by pass for Long Stratton.  There was actually planning permission for a bypass some while ago but the last  government never came up with the money.</span> </p>
<p class="newsbody">The planning permission has now lapsed  and the coalition government is digging us out of a big financial hole. We have  been printing money and lending it to ourselves to pay the wages for nurses,  doctors and teachers. It is quite unrealistic to think the government will  magic up the cash for a bypass. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The only possibility is a bypass funded by development.&nbsp;  Last time there was this chance the council voted against, ending up with extra  houses but no bypass. I hope we don&rsquo;t make that mistake again.</p>
