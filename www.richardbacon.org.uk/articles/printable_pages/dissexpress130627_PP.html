<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt"><br>
  South Norfolk MP Richard 
Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p><span class="artsub">HEROES HONOURED AT  LAST </span><span class="artsub"><a name="heroes" id="heroes"></a></span><br>
    <span class="newsbody">Last week the Government announced that veterans who served  on the Arctic Convoys in World War II will be allowed to accept the Ushakov  Medal from the Russian Government.</span></p>
<p class="newsbody">The Medal, named after a Russian naval hero who fought with  Nelson,&nbsp; is given to all Arctic Convoy veterans.&nbsp; US and Commonwealth veterans can already wear  the Medal but bizarre Foreign Office rules said that, as the event to be  honoured was over five years ago and Britain had already awarded them the  Arctic Star, British veterans couldn&rsquo;t accept the Medal.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">I was pleased to play some small part in the campaign to  allow veterans to accept the Russian peoples&rsquo; recognition of their service so  I&rsquo;m delighted that the Government has now done the right thing by these  extraordinarily brave men.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub"><strong>LONG STRATTON</strong></span><a name="lsb"></a><br>
  Getting a bypass for Long Stratton is one of my top  priorities as your local MP and if you live, work or travel through Long  Stratton every day, then you&rsquo;ll know that the village desperately needs to be  bypassed.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Long Stratton will need to grow if the bypass is to be  delivered and this growth will also provide new jobs, better services and  improved facilities.&nbsp; In order to guide  this growth, South Norfolk Council has drawn up a detailed draft Area Action  Plan for Long Stratton.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Council is currently taking comments on the Long  Stratton Area Action Plan at <a href="http://www.south-norfolk.gov.uk/longstratton" class="tsb">www.south-norfolk.gov.uk/longstratton</a>.&nbsp; The consultation will end at 5pm on Friday 26  July and I&rsquo;ll be putting my comments in to the Council very soon.&nbsp; I hope that you&rsquo;ll do the same.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub"><strong>TELL THE TAXMAN</strong></span><a name="tax"></a><br>
  Small business owners in my constituency often tell me they&rsquo;re  fed up with HM Revenue &amp; Customs crushing them with an iron fist whilst  huge multinational firms like Vodafone get the gentle touch.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">HMRC recently asked MPs &nbsp;for our views on its performance but, as far  as I am concerned, it&rsquo;s your views that matter most.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">I want to give HMRC chapter and verse on its service to my  constituents and so I&rsquo;m going to need your help.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a small business owner or an  ordinary taxpayer in my constituency and you want to share your experiences of HMRC  , be they good or bad, then I want to hear from you.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">Please email me at <a href="mailto:tellthetaxman@richardbacon.org.uk" class="tsb">tellthetaxman@richardbacon.org.uk</a> and I will make sure HMRC hears what you have to say.&nbsp; </p>
