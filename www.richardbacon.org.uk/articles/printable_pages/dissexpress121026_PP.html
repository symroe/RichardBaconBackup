<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt">South Norfolk MP Richard 
Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub"><strong><u>THE VIKINGS ARE  COMING!</u></strong></span>
  <br>
I  am delighted that the Vikings are coming to Diss to be honoured with the  Freedom of the Town and I want to pay tribute to Diss Town Council and Mayor  Graham Minshull for their tireless work in making this parade happen.&nbsp;  Thanks must also go to Diss&rsquo;s District Councillors, Keith Kiddie, Glyn Walden  and Tony Palmer for their support.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">This  is our chance to honour the brave men and women who have given so much in  service of our country.&nbsp; Their bravery and sacrifice is truly humbling and  we are all tremendously proud of them.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">It will be a truly  exceptional day and I hope to see you there.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub"><strong><u>ON THE BEAT</u></strong></span> <br>
  You  may have seen me out and about on the streets of Diss recently in the company  of Inspector Alice Scott, who is in charge of policing in the town.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Inspector  Scott, who began her policing career in Diss, told me first-hand about the  issues facing the police locally, also introducing me to local businesses and  organisations who are playing their part in keeping crime in Diss under  control.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">I  took this message into a recent meeting with Norfolk&rsquo;s Chief Constable, who is  a keen supporter of the community-based approach adopted by police officers in  Diss.&nbsp; Being a victim of crime can be a terrifying experience, but our  police force generally does an excellent job and that&rsquo;s why Norfolk is one of  the safest places to live in the country.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub"><strong><u>POLICE &amp; CRIME  COMMISSIONERS</u></strong></span><br>
  Talking  of the police, Norfolk&rsquo;s voters will go to the polls on 15 November to choose  the county&rsquo;s first ever elected Police and Crime Commissioner. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The  person who is elected will be responsible for deciding on Norfolk Police&rsquo;s  priorities and for setting the budget, including the police precept on your  council tax bill.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the new Commissioner won&rsquo;t be able to  tell police officers who gets investigated or arrested.&nbsp; Norfolk&rsquo;s Chief  Constable will stay in operational control of the force.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Elected  police commissioners give the public a direct say in local policing and they  will answer to you through the ballot box.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t leave this  decision to anyone else because they may be leaving it up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Please make sure you vote on 15 November.</p>
