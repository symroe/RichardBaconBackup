<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt"> South Norfolk MP Richard 
  Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p><span class="artsub">LADY THATCHER&nbsp; 1925-2013</span> <br>
  <span class="newsbody">The recent passing of Baroness Thatcher was, for me, a very  sad day.&nbsp; She had a fierce and unshakeable belief in this country at a  time when many people has lost all hope in the future.</span></p>
<p class="newsbody">Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s belief that this country could restore  its fortunes by its own efforts was a personal inspiration to many people to enter  politics, including me.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Of course, not everyone reading this will agree with Lady  Thatcher&rsquo;s convictions but I firmly believe that you can disagree profoundly  with someone yet still have the highest respect for their courage,  determination and service to their country.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Her legacy in transforming the prospects for this country  and in ending the Cold War is of great historical importance.&nbsp; Her passing  marks the end of a very great life.</p>
<p><span class="artsub">AMBULANCE UPDATE</span> <br>
    <span class="newsbody">Since my last column, the East of England Ambulance Service  has stayed in the news.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Chair of the Ambulance Trust has resigned and the Health  Minister Earl Howe has also written to me to let me know he has launched a  review into the way our ambulance service is being run.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">You&rsquo;ll also have seen over Easter that the ambulance service  erected a tent at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital to care for patients and  free ambulances for duty.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m assured by the hospital&rsquo;s Chief Executive  that the N&amp;N is working with the ambulance trust to tackle delays and slash  the amount of time ambulances spend waiting at A&amp;E.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">However, I&rsquo;ve also asked the body that represents the  N&amp;N&rsquo;s consultants if they will help to get this situation improved.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class="artsub">COUNTY COUNCIL ELECTIONS</span> <br>
    <span class="newsbody">Norfolk will be going to the polls on Thursday 2 May 2013 to  vote the County Council elections.&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p class="newsbody">Every four years voters elect 84 councillors from across the  whole of Norfolk to make decisions about county-wide services, including  schools, social services, highways and libraries.&nbsp; These are very  important services and the County Council&rsquo;s performance on&nbsp; these  bread-and-butter issues is at the heart of this election.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">National issues are important but please make sure you put  the future of Norfolk first when you cast your vote. These elections are your  chance to choose who will represent you when decisions are taken by the County  Council.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class="newsbody">Your vote is your voice, so please make sure your voice is  heard by voting in this year&rsquo;s County Council elections on Thursday 2 May 2013</span>.</p>
