  <p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt"> South Norfolk MP Richard 
            Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
          <p class="newsbody"> Last week I joined pig farmers from across the UK as they  descended on Downing Street for a rally to draw national attention to the  plight of the British Pig Industry.&nbsp; Each week, supermarkets make around  &pound;16 million in profit from pork, but UK pig farmers are losing &pound;3 million a  week, equating to just over &pound;20 on every pig sold. </p>
          <p class="newsbody">I was delighted to be invited to be the first MP to sign a  giant 16ft sausage in support of the campaign.&nbsp; MPs and celebrities,  including Olympian Sharron Davies MBE and pop-star Liz McClarnon also gave  their support to our pig farmers.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="newsbody">Pig farming makes a valuable  contribution to rural economies across the UK, especially in East Anglia.&nbsp;  I will continue to do all I can to help pig farmers&nbsp;fight to protect their  livelihoods.</p>
          <p class="artsub">Beccles & District M.E. support group<a name="sub1"></a><br>
            <span class="newsbody">I visited the Beccles & District M.E. support group last week with my parliamentary colleague Peter Aldous MP.&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="newsbody">The group provides much-needed support to ME sufferers in Diss and the Waveney Valley.&nbsp;
            
          Myalgic Encephalopathy (M.E.) is a debilitating illness which causes severe fatigue and muscle pain.&nbsp;Nobody really knows what causes M.E., although it is globally recognised as a neurological illness.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="newsbody">Some people still think M.E. is &lsquo;all in the mind&rsquo;.&nbsp;Members of the group have had to fight hard to get their condition taken seriously by the authorities, and greatly value having a GP who truly understands their condition.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="newsbody">The coming NHS changes should  help M.E. sufferers, as GPs will have the power and the resources to ensure that their patients living with M.E. get access to proper treatment.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="newsbody">If you would like to know more, please contact me on 01379 651979 and I can put you in touch with the group</p>
          <p class="artsub">Vinces Road<a name="sub2"></a><br>
            <span class="newsbody">Anyone using Victoria Road at rush hour will know only too  well that Diss has not been well served by planning decisions in the  past.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
          <p class="newsbody">That is why I was pleased to hear that an agreement has been  reached on plans to build 120 homes off Frenze Hall Lane in Diss.&nbsp; The  original proposals for the site were not sympathetic to Diss&rsquo;s needs and South  Norfolk councillors threw out those proposals because of poor  design.&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution which has now been agreed is not perfect but  it is certainly an improvement on what was originally proposed.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="newsbody">The decision on this site has sparked renewed interest  generally in the debate on Diss&rsquo;s future growth and I hope the Localism Bill  will give Diss much greater power over its own future.        </p>
