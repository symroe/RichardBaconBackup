<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt"> South Norfolk MP Richard 
      Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
    <p class="newsbody">Last week, I met with Transport Minister Norman Baker to discuss funding for free bus travel for the over 60s in Norfolk. </p>
    <p class="newsbody">On present arrangements, Norfolk County Council is some &pound;3 million out of pocket, even though the county has made significant changes to save money.&nbsp;The reason is that Norfolk is so rural.&nbsp;The average travel distance of three miles on which the formula is based is woefully short of the Norfolk average which is about 14 miles.</p>
    <p class="newsbody">We all know there are difficult decisions to take, but the  Government must still produce a workable policy which recognises that longer  journey distances are a normal part of everyday life in rural areas.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;m pleased to say that the Minister has agreed to raise  this issue with the Department for Communities and Local Government which also  takes responsibility for the scheme.</p>
    <p class="artsub">Hope for adults with aspergers<a name="sub1"></a><br>
        <span class="newsbody"> For a number of years I have pressed for a dedicated service for adults with Asperger Syndrome so I am delighted to learn that Asperger Service Norfolk is up and running and proving to be a great success.&nbsp;The service is run by Norfolk County Council, NHS Norfolk, Great Yarmouth and Waveney NHS Trust and Asperger East Anglia. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="newsbody">Following referral or diagnosis, the client and team member  decide how much and what type of support is needed for the client to live life  to his or her full potential. This could mean help with housing, benefits,  finding work, improving social skills as well as being introduced to other  specialised services. Help is also on hand for parents and carers and the team  is initiating Asperger awareness training to a range of health professionals  and other organisations.</p>
    <p class="newsbody">By preventing problems from arising, the team is also proving to be highly cost-effective. Now, that has to be good news.</p>
    <p class="artsub">Diss Business Forum<a name="sub2"></a><br>
        <span class="newsbody">I was pleased to join members of Diss Business Forum for a business breakfast last week. The forum is led by local businesswoman Jenna Cox and is a good place to network with other businesses, to hear about local concerns and to share experiences of common problems. </span></p>
    <p class="newsbody">Forum members asked a wide range of questions covering  issues such as priorities for investment in the local area, how to influence  the new local enterprise partnership, work permits, and progress on improving  broadband links. If you would like to know more, contact Jenna Cox on 0845 108  6256.</p>
