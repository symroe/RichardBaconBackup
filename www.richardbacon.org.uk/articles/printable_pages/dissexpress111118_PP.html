<div class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none"><a name="headline"></a>Bank boost for local businesses</div>

<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt">South Norfolk MP Richard 
Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
  <div>
    <p class="newsbody"><img src="/images/LS_Barclays_1.jpg" alt="" id="LHpic" title="Richard Bacon MP (left) with Barclays Long Stratton branch manager Denise Walker">The  anger directed at Britain&rsquo;s biggest banks is easy enough to understand. Our  local branches are now working hard to regain people&rsquo;s trust and to make sure  people get the message that banks are lending to help new businesses get off  the ground.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody">I  popped into Barclays&rsquo; Long Stratton branch to learn more about what they are up  to locally. Some people who apply for business loans have almost no idea of  what lenders will expect to see in terms of a business plan, and the banks are  making more effort to change this. The bank&rsquo;s community-based business managers  have good local knowledge and they have been running free Business Lending  Clinics across East Anglia to provide advice how to apply for finance  successfully.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="newsbody">I  suggested that they should do more of this, perhaps even in public places like  The Forum.&nbsp; The banks have a vital role to play in economic recovery by  supporting budding local businesses.</p>
    <p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify">Tesco for schools<a name="sub1"></a><br>
        <span class="newsbody"> Last  week I was pleased to present a variety of equipment to Roydon Primary School  and Diss Infants and Nursery School, whose parents collected Tesco  vouchers.&nbsp; The schools received over 60,000 vouchers, allowing them to  choose from expensive items such as camcorders, inkjet printers and binoculars  as well as craft products and musical instruments.</span></p>
    <p class="newsbody">Both  schools said were looking forward to putting the equipment to good use.  &nbsp;Tesco&rsquo;s schools voucher scheme is just one of the ways the company helps  the local community. As well as being one of the largest employers in Diss,  Tesco run football clubs and an FA Skills programme for boys and girls and  grants are also available for local projects. I am pleased to see Tesco putting  something back into the local community.</p>
    <p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify">Roundtable for farmers<a name="sub2"></a><br>
        <span class="newsbody"> I  joined local members of the National Farmers Union last week for a roundtable  to discuss a wide range of farming issues. Egg farmers are worried that their  investment to meet tough new EU production standards may be undermined unless  the proposed ban on eggs imports which do not meet the standards is policed  properly.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify"><span class="newsbody">There are similar concerns about pig meat. And, almost  unbelievably, farmers have to face yet another round of reforming the common  agricultural policy, which last time led to the fiasco of the Rural Payments  Agency. Meanwhile, the crisis in the eurozone was a major concern since all  payments under the EU&rsquo;s common agricultural policy are made in euros. </span></p>
    <p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify"><span class="newsbody">One piece  of good news is that mandatory country-of-origin labelling for meat is finally  on the way.</span></p>
