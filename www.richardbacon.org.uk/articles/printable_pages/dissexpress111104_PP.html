    <p class="newsbody"><img src="/images/111013_LS.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" id="LHpic" title="South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon (centre, on stage) addresses the audience at the Long Stratton public meeting">Residents of Long Stratton had the ear of all their elected  representatives from Parish to Parliament  last week at a public meeting of the  parish council held at the High School. </p>
    <p class="newsbody">The meeting aimed to find out what residents would like to  see in the Long Stratton of the future. South Norfolk Council is currently  consulting on where it should build new homes and businesses needed to fund the  long-awaited A140 bypass, as well as the infrastructure to support the village  as it grows. </p>
    <p class="newsbody">Views at the meeting were varied. One particularly interesting  suggestion was for a Long Stratton Business Park along similar lines to Hethel  Engineering Centre.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody">It was a very useful meeting and we all went away with food  for thought.&nbsp; Thank you to everyone who gave up their Friday evening to  come along.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify">Norfolk is best for food!<a name="sub1"></a><br>
        <span class="newsbody"> I am one of the first to sing the praises of the wonderful  food produced in Norfolk so I was delighted that the Norfolk Food Festival made  such a big hit when it visited Parliament last week, with Ministers and MPs  crowding into Westminster to taste Norfolk&rsquo;s finest products.</span></p>
    <p class="newsbody">Exhibitors included Swannington Farm to Fork, who produce  some of the best sausages you will ever taste, the wonderful handmade cheeses  from Ferndale Farmhouse in Little Barningham, and the excellent Bray&rsquo;s Cottage  Pork Pies, all of which could be washed down with tasty Woodforde&rsquo;s Norfolk  Ales. </p>
    <p class="newsbody">There were plenty of ideas for Christmas gifts too, from  Lady Jay&rsquo;s Preserves and Marmalades to The English Whisky Company near East  Harling, who will produce bespoke presentation bottles of England&rsquo;s first  single malt whisky as well as offering guided tours of their distillery, and  Norfolk Cordial, whose marvellous products such as Strawberry and Lime cordial  and Red Gooseberry and Wild Elderflower can be used for desserts, baking,  sorbets and ice creams.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody">There is no shortage of fine local food producers  in Norfolk and we should do all we can to support them.</p>
    <p><span class="artsub" style="text-align:justify">No to Pylons<a name="sub2"></a></span><br>
        <span class="newsbody">Parish representatives and other residents from across the  Waveney Valley attended Wortwell Community Centre last week to meet with  National Grid about the possibility of pylons in the Waveney Valley.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="newsbody">Electricity will need to be brought ashore from the wind  farms which are planned off the coast of East Anglia.&nbsp; National Grid says  it has not yet made any decisions as to where and how this will happen but the  company&rsquo;s representatives were left in no doubt at a packed meeting that the  option of electricity pylons along the Waveney Valley is a non-starter.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody">Waveney Valley is being promoted as a tourist  destination,&nbsp;even getting some help from taxpayers to do so, and it would  be crazy to ruin this beautiful part of the world with electricity  pylons.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody">Making sure National Grid understands this at such an early stage  is very sensible. I will be keeping a close watch on this.</p>
