		    <p class="artsub"><span style="text-align:justify" >South  Norfolk is in good hands with our local police team, whom I met last week. </span></p>
		    <p class="newsbody">Chief Inspector Tracey Prowting is overseeing the South Norfolk area as a whole  while Inspector Gavin Money is working in the Diss, Harleston and Long Stratton  neighbourhoods.</span></p>
		    <p class="newsbody">Most  crime is committed by the same people committing one offence after another, so  it makes sense for the police to make a big effort on steering people away from  re-offending. For example, if someone is stealing to fund a drug habit it will  only stop if you sort out the drug problem.&nbsp; </p>
		    <p class="newsbody">Chief Inspector Prowting  tells me this approach has already had some notable successes in getting people  away from a life of crime. </p>
		    <p class="artsub">Green  flag for park<br>
		      <span class="newsbody"> Diss  Town Council&rsquo;s plan to regenerate the park by the Mere and apply for Green Flag  status is excellent. It will help to attract more tourists to the town, which  has to be good for the local economy.&nbsp; I was pleased to note that on the  &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list is new play and fitness equipment for older children to use, which  will help combat anti-social behaviour in Diss.</span></p>
		    <p class="newsbody">I  am up for being a Friend of Diss Park and it&rsquo;s good news that celebrity  gardener Bob Flowerdew has agreed to be patron. I have written to Project  Manager Sue Reeve to offer my support especially in getting further funding for  the project. I look forward to watching the project blossom!</p>
		    <p class="artsub">Long  Stratton bypass<br>
		      <span class="newsbody">The  section of the A140 that runs through Long Stratton is an appalling  bottleneck.&nbsp; Because no public money is available for road improvements,  the only hope for a bypass is for a by-pass to be funded by new homes.&nbsp;  Housing developments are often controversial but this would be delivering a  bypass which Long Stratton badly needs.</span></p>
	        <p class="newsbody">However,  developers in the Wymondham area want Long Stratton to lose its only realistic  chance for a bypass so that they can build thousands more unwanted houses along  the A11.&nbsp; A bypass would bring significant improvements to the quality of  life of South Norfolk residents, not just those in Long Stratton itself.&nbsp;</p>
			  <p class="newsbody">The  housing plans for South Norfolk, including the bypass, are currently being  examined and&nbsp;I wrote to the planning inspector in charge and to make sure he  understands how badly the Long Stratton bypass is needed.&nbsp;</p>
