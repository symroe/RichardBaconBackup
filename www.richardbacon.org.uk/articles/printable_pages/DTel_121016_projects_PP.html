<hr size="1" id="line">
<h3><em><strong>The West Coast Mainline rail fiasco should be unbelievable. </strong></em></h3>
<p class="newsbody">The head of the Institute for Government, Peter Riddell, blogged that it  goes to the heart of the Civil Service&rsquo;s credibility and reputation for  competence: &ldquo;At a time when relations between some ministers and some senior  civil servants are already strained, the disclosures could hardly be more  damaging.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The permanent secretary at the Department for Transport, Philip Rutnam,  has been grovelling publicly. With other train operators stalled, there are now  warnings that the compensation bill alone could reach &pound;100 million. Exasperated  taxpayers will reflect that the government has once again wasted millions of  pounds of their hard-earned money. Yet the truth is that many people will not  even be surprised. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Government routinely makes an appalling mess of things. Some years ago a  single edition of The Daily Telegraph reported that a nuclear submarine  suffered &pound;5 million of damage after crashing into rocks because trainee  commanders covered vital charts with tracing paper; that a government  efficiency drive in the Department for Transport to save &pound;112 million was  likely to cost &pound;120 million while sending messages to employees in German and  denying them annual leave to which they were entitled; that hundreds of  thousands of immigrants were excluded from official statistics by a counting  system which was so unreliable that it was not possible to know the true  population of Britain; and that more than 8,000 patients had died in dirty  hospitals after contracting superbugs. And that was just one day&rsquo;s headlines. </p>
<p class="newsbody">In recent years we have seen a pension regulatory body which had no  objectives; an urban regeneration project which had no budget; a military  communications project where no one was in charge; a re-negotiated NHS dental  contract which left large numbers of people without a dentist; a bizarre system  for recruiting hospital doctors which drove talented medics to emigrate; a new  system for marking school tests where three quarters of the marking was wrong  (long before the recent row over GCSEs); and of course the Ministry of </p>
<p class="newsbody">Defence, whose dreadful procurement record &ndash; including boots that melt  in hot weather, helicopters that won&rsquo;t fly in the rain, radios that don&rsquo;t fit  into battle tanks, naval frigates with no weapons, aircraft carriers with no  fighter jets, and military transport aircraft that can&rsquo;t fly into war zones &ndash;  amply justifies Ernest Fitzgerald&rsquo;s maxim that &ldquo;there are only two phases of a  weapons programme: &lsquo;Too early to tell&rsquo; and &lsquo;too late to stop&rsquo; &rdquo;. </p>
<p class="newsbody">In large areas of public life, especially when the government decides to  embark on anything new, it is quite normal for things not to turn out as  planned. Given the track record, one might expect the quality of government  spending and public management to be the subject of national attention. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Why don&rsquo;t people learn the lessons of past failure? The short timescales  of ministers anxious to make a quick impact do not help, nor does the fact that  the recruiting process for civil servants puts a premium on pure brain power  rather than the ability to get things done. Yet the deeper truth is that many  politicians, senior civil servants and the media are less interested in  learning from past mistakes than getting on with the next policy initiative,  the next project, or the next story. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Major Projects Authority &ndash; a partnership between the Cabinet Office  and the Treasury launched just 18 months ago under a prime ministerial mandate  &ndash; may just possibly break this vicious cycle. Its purpose is to offer assurance  that the government portfolio of over 200 major projects worth &pound;376 billion are  on track, and to provide early warning &ndash; and practical help &ndash; if things go  wrong. Projects range from large IT systems to defence equipment such as ships  and helicopters, and the implementation of major changes to how services are  delivered. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Tuesday&rsquo;s report from the public accounts committee welcomes the  Authority&rsquo;s early success. On the advice of the Authority the notorious  national programme for IT in the NHS was finally dismantled, the Home Office&rsquo;s  plans for &ldquo;e-Borders&rdquo; were sent back to the drawing board, and the Department  for Energy and Climate Change scrapped the first competition for carbon capture  and storage. Reviews are more exacting than in the past, with greater  discipline and more use of hard evidence. But there is still much to do. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Authority cannot stop projects or withdraw funding. The Treasury is  not routinely using information to inform spending decisions, while not all  departments are keen to engage. And the Authority is simply too small to do the  job it was designed for, with just 38 staff. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Major Projects Authority was not asked to comment on the economic  model or the assumptions used in the West Coast Mainline franchising process,  although with better independent scrutiny the process would not have gone so  badly wrong with such calamitous consequences for taxpayers. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Authority costs just &pound;6 million &ndash; or 0.0016 per cent of the &pound;376  billion of projects it is expected to scrutinise, or, to put in another way,  less than the cost of the British consulate in Basra which is now being closed.  No private sector organisation would take such huge risks while spending  hundreds of billions of pounds. Taxpayers deserve better. </p>
<p class="newsbody">To do its job properly, the Authority should be larger, financed with  cuts elsewhere. The Department for Work and Pensions has 112 people in its  press office. The Ministry of Justice has 165. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Civil servants don&rsquo;t always have the right skills. They need to get them  and the Authority&rsquo;s new major projects academy at Oxford will help. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Future progress as a senior civil servant should only occur after time  spent in the Authority with a track record of success. The real question should  not be if we can afford this. Given how much of our money has been squandered  by successive governments, the real question is: Why should my constituents  tolerate anything less? </p>
