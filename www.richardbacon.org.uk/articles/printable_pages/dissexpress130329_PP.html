  Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p><span class="artsub">AMBULANCE VISIT</span> <br>
    <span class="newsbody">Our ambulance service has been in turmoil recently, so I  visited the Norwich ambulance control room to see operations for myself.&nbsp;  Given the local concern over Diss&rsquo;s ambulance cover, I invited Mayor Graham  Minshull to join me.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="newsbody">We had a useful introduction to the way the service operates  from control room managers.&nbsp; Then I sat with a dispatcher to watch him  deploy ambulances across our region.&nbsp; I have no doubt about the commitment  of frontline staff.&nbsp; They do a terrific job under enormous pressure and we  are all in their debt. However, I think they deserve much better leadership  from the Trust Board.&nbsp; It is also clear that targets are distorting  management decisions, leading to greater frustration for staff. </p>
<p class="newsbody">It&rsquo;s time to question whether one ambulance service can  serve both outer London <em>and</em> rural East Anglia properly.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t  believe that it can.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class="artsub">MATERNITY SERVICES</span><br>
    <span class="newsbody">I want to thank everyone who contacted me with their  experiences of NHS maternity services in Norfolk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="newsbody">It is clear from the response that new mums generally have  high praise for the doctors, nurses and midwives who looked after them.&nbsp;  However, there&rsquo;s also a big question over whether there&rsquo;s enough support for  mums-to-be in rural areas.&nbsp; The need to travel long distances to get to  Norwich can be both exhausting and expensive for expectant parents.&nbsp;  There&rsquo;s also the question of capacity at the Norfolk &amp; Norwich, which can  often see women diverted to other hospitals in Norfolk or Suffolk at the 11th  hour.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The contributions I received will be passed to the National  Audit Office to inform their forthcoming report to Parliament.&nbsp; Thank you  again for your help.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class="artsub">SELF BUILD</span><br>
    <span class="newsbody">Like most things, housing operates on the principle of  supply and demand.&nbsp; Because the demand is high but the supply is low,  houses quickly become very expensive to rent or buy.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="newsbody">What we really need is more houses.&nbsp; The are many  beautiful villages in my constituency that would still be just as beautiful  with a handful of extra houses, particularly for local people who grew up  there.&nbsp; In South Norfolk, just 0.6 percent of the land is housing, whereas  92 percent is countryside.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">I think part of the answer is to help people build a house  themselves.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m launching the All Party Parliamentary Group on  Self-Build.&nbsp; My aim is to help make it much easier for people to get some  land, get planning permission and build their own home.&nbsp;</p>
