Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">AMBULANCE CUTS</span> <br>
Many of you have been in touch with me regarding the state  of the ambulance service in Norfolk.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">I&nbsp;know many Diss residents are concerned about the time  it takes for ambulances to answer 999 calls in the town.&nbsp; This happens  because ambulances based in Diss are sent to emergency calls as far away as  Luton!&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The ambulance Trust is to review the gap between its desired  performance and what it currently achieves.&nbsp; Rather strangely, however, by  the time the review is finished, the Trust will already have gone ahead with  plans to cut one of Diss&rsquo;s two 24-hour emergency ambulances. </p>
<p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;ve asked the new ambulance boss, Andrew Morgan to put a  stop to these changes until the Trust&rsquo;s review is complete.&nbsp; I will let  you know what he has to say.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">TURBINES PLAN BACK FROM THE DEAD</span> <br>
  When a Planning Inspector threw out plans for three 400-foot  tall wind turbines between Dickleburgh, Rushall and the Pulhams, local  residents must have hoped that they had seen the back of this hare-brained  scheme for good.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Unfortunately, they were wrong, as I discovered when an  &lsquo;information leaflet&rsquo; from energy firm TCI Renewables was pushed through my  letterbox in Diss.&nbsp; The leaflet proclaimed that TCI had moved the giant  turbines slightly further away from affected homes, and that they now believed  the scheme was OK.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">They have completely missed the point.&nbsp; The vast  majority of local residents have made it crystal clear that they don&rsquo;t want  giant industrial turbines anywhere near their homes, but TCI refuse to take  &lsquo;no&rsquo; for an answer.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">TCI Renewables needs to take the hint and drop these plans  for good.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">HANDY HELP FOR WINTER</span><br>
  Hopefully we&rsquo;re through the worst of the snow, but temperatures as low  as -12&deg;c mean extra work to keep our homes dry and warm.&nbsp; For most people,  that&rsquo;s simply part of home ownership but elderly and vulnerable residents may  struggle to do small running repairs.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">That&rsquo;s why I wanted to say a few words in praise of South  Norfolk Council&rsquo;s &lsquo;Your Handyperson&rsquo; scheme.&nbsp; The scheme aims to help  older or less able residents with small repairs to their homes and  gardens.&nbsp; In most cases, the work is free but a discounted  service is also available.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Everyone on the handyperson scheme is an approved South  Norfolk Council contractor, so you can be sure you&rsquo;re in safe hands.&nbsp; If  you want to know more, please call South Norfolk Council on 01508 533705.</p>
