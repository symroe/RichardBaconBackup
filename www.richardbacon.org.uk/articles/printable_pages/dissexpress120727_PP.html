<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt"> South Norfolk MP Richard 
  Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="bigword6"><strong>DISS HIGH SCHOOL </strong></span><br>
  <img src="/images/120703_DHS_POW_2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267" id="LHpic">One of the best parts of my job is that I get to talk to  young people about the work of Parliament and why it&rsquo;s so important.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s  even more fun when I can welcome them to Westminster and show them first  hand. </p>
<p class="newsbody">That&rsquo;s why I was delighted that pupils from Diss High School  made the trip down to the Houses of Parliament.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">After showing them around the Lords, the Commons, the voting  lobbies and Westminster Hall (including the Jubilee window, above), I took their questions, which ranged from how  Parliament works to issues of the day.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to see school children from South  Norfolk visiting Parliament and I hope other schools will arrange visits  too.&nbsp; For more information please telephone 01379 643728.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="bigword6"><strong>LONG MEADOW </strong></span><br>
  I was pleased to hear that South Norfolk Council&rsquo;s planning  committee rejected pleas from the Long&nbsp; Meadow developer, CZero, for  massive cuts in the contributions to schools and roads it had promised to make  when it first got planning permission.</p>
<p class="newsbody">South Norfolk Council sent out a clear message to developers  across the district: we expect you to stand by your promises.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t  agree more.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The National Audit Office has also written to me to say that  it&rsquo;s looking very closely at the &pound;3 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money which the  Department of Energy and Climate Change provided to CZero.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;m told that a team is reviewing papers and interviewing  officials.</p>
<p class="newsbody">It&rsquo;s good to know that the public spending watchdog is  taking this matter seriously and I&rsquo;ll report back when I know more.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="bigword6"><strong>FLYING THE FLAG FOR DISS&rsquo;S PARK</strong></span><br>
  Diss is rightly proud of its park, which I&rsquo;m lucky enough to  be able to see from the windows of my office in the town.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">It&rsquo;s excellent news that the hard work which Diss Town  Council puts into keeping the park clean and green has been recognised  with&nbsp;the award of a Green Flag.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The Green Flag Award scheme sets the national standard for  parks and green spaces in the UK.&nbsp; Launched in 1996, the scheme is similar  to the Blue Flag for beaches and marinas. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Green Flag also helps to encourage parks to achieve high  environmental standards and the public can be sure that a park flying a Green  Flag is a high quality green space, which can only boost to its popularity.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement!</p>
