  <p class="newsbody"><img src="/images/RB_DOV_400px.jpg" alt="" name="LHpic" width="400" height="289" id="LHpic" title="South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon (right) opens Diss on View with Diss Town Mayor Mike Bardwell (centre) and Diss Business Forum Chairman Ed Nottingham">It was a pleasure to open &lsquo;Diss on View&rsquo; at the Park Hotel  recently together with Mayor Mike Bardwell.&nbsp; The Diss Business Forum event  showcasing local businesses and services has been running since 2007 and it  gets better each year, with companies from as far afield as Ipswich taking  part. <span style="text-align:justify" ></span></p>
  <p class="newsbody">There were various stands from accountants, solicitors,  estate agents and insurance brokers as well as groups such as Cittaslow and  Diss Rugby Club.&nbsp; &lsquo;Diss on View&rsquo; is open to the public and also provides  an opportunity for businesses to network, which can be especially important in  difficult economic times. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">When I opened the first Diss on View, I hoped it would  become an annual event. Congratulations to Diss Business Forum&rsquo;s hard work for  making that hope come true. </p>
  <p class="artsub">Pylon Threat<a name="sub1"></a><br>
      <span class="newsbody"> I am very concerned about the possibility of new large electricity pylons along the Waveney Valley spoiling this beautiful, tranquil part of South Norfolk and North Suffolk.&nbsp;I wrote to National Grid asking for their assurance that the company is looking positively at burying underground any planned transmission cables. National Grid say that details of the connection and its location have yet to be identified and the project is in its early stages but consultations will take place before final decisions are made. </span></p>
  <p class="newsbody">I can assure you that I will be keeping a close eye on  progress.&nbsp; Councillor Martin Wilby and I will be meeting local town and  parish councillors representing areas along the Waveney Valley next month. </p>
  <p class="artsub">Enterprising Rotary Club<a name="sub2"></a><br>
      <span class="newsbody">I was delighted to meet members of Diss &amp; District  Rotary Club the other day at their weekly event. What an impressive array of  activities Rotarians get involved in!&nbsp; In the local community, they  support older citizens with very specific needs such as helping with the  purchase of a new wheelchair, while also working to boost youngsters&rsquo;  confidence with everything from mock interviews to placements for leadership  training. &nbsp;In international development, Diss &amp; District branch helps  with fresh water projects for villages in Zambia and cataract operations in  India.</span></p>
  <p class="newsbody">Rotarians also provide a great network for those travelling  abroad. One Rotarian visitor from Australia attended the Diss event, bringing  greetings from Down Under. If we could only bottle this kind of enterprise and  enthusiasm, there would be few problems which would seem quite so  insurmountable.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">The Rotary Club motto &lsquo;Service Above Self&rsquo; has something  to tell us all.</p>
