<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt">South Norfolk MP Richard 
Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">SAFFRON APPRENTICESHIPS</span> <br>
One of the biggest problems facing any small business which  is considering taking on apprentices is the extra administrative burden.  Saffron Housing Trust may have found the answer. Members of the Diss Business  Forum gathered recently to learn more about Saffron&rsquo;s excellent apprenticeship  scheme. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Saffron plans to give 20 local businesses the ability to  take on their first apprentice next year and, by handling the administration,  Saffron will free local businesses from much of the day-to-day worry involved  in apprenticeships.&nbsp; The apprentices will work four days a week and spend  the fifth day studying.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">This is a simple, common sense idea with real potential and  I will shortly be meeting the Apprenticeships Minister and West Suffolk MP Matt  Hancock to draw his attention to the scheme. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">HARLESTON NATIONWIDE</span> <br>
  You may remember that I wrote in last month&rsquo;s column about  Nationwide&rsquo;s intention to close its Harleston branch.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">After that I was joined by local business Harleston leaders  to discuss these proposals on an hour-long conference call with senior Nationwide  managers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will say that Nationwide listened carefully and  considerately to our arguments, but unfortunately it became clear that the  building society has no intention of changing its mind, which is a great  pity.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">It is not easy for any building society or bank to make  small branches work but the decision to close the Harleston branch still seems  short-sighted, particularly as the town grows over the coming years.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS</span><br>
  Earlier in the year, I wrote to  NHS Norfolk and Waveney about care home fees but the response I got back was  packed with jargon and almost unintelligible.&nbsp; What on earth is a  &lsquo;negative financial uplift&rsquo;?</p>
<p class="newsbody">It prompted me to nominate NHS  Norfolk for the Plain English Campaign&rsquo;s &lsquo;Golden Bull&rsquo; award for worst written  nonsense.&nbsp; The Plain English Campaign recently declared NHS Norfolk and  Waveney a Winner of a 2012 Golden Bull Award!</p>
<p class="newsbody">The awards are a bit of fun with a  serious side.&nbsp; When MPs write to organisations on behalf of our  constituents, we want to be able to share the replies we receive, explain what  they mean and give advice about what to do next.&nbsp; That is much more  difficult unless public bodies which serve the public use clear plain English.</p>
<p><strong><span class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">CHRISTMAS WISHES</span><br>
  Finally, I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to wish you all a very merry Christmas and a happy and prosperous 2013.</span></strong><br>
