<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt"> South Norfolk MP Richard 
  Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="bigword6"><strong>WIND  FARMS</strong></span><br>
  You may have seen that last month the High Court rejected  plans for four wind turbines at Hemsby, near Great Yarmouth. In her ruling, Mrs  Justice Lang found that the risk of damage to the landscape was more important  than renewable energy policies. </p>
<p class="newsbody">This decision has massive implications for wind farm  projects across England and South Norfolk. It means that wind energy firms  can&rsquo;t just use &lsquo;being green&rsquo; as an excuse for plonking gigantic alien  structures in the middle of our countryside. It also means that they&rsquo;ve got to  pay more attention to protecting our countryside.</p>
<p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;ve always said that there&rsquo;s a place for wind energy. That  place is on remote moorland or out at sea, not in a gentle rural landscape like  ours.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="bigword6"><strong>PYLONS</strong></span><br>
  Whilst we&rsquo;re talking about power, you may recall that  Waveney Valley residents met with National Grid at Wortwell Community Centre  last year to talk about the possibility of pylons in the Waveney Valley. </p>
<p class="newsbody">I understand that National Grid now think they won&rsquo;t need to  put pylons along the Waveney and are looking at other routes instead. This may  yet change but I hope we&rsquo;ve seen the back of this crazy idea for good.</p>
<p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;ve also heard that when National Grid came to the meeting  last year, the united front against the proposals had a lot to do with  persuading them that they should probably be looking elsewhere. </p>
<p class="newsbody">This is proof that that local communities are far from  powerless and also goes to show just what &lsquo;people power&rsquo; can achieve! </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="bigword6"><strong>PIGS</strong></span><br>
  Well done to our pig farmers for reaching a deal to export  British pig products to China.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Pork production in China just can&rsquo;t keep up with local  demand but thanks to this deal, British Pork will at last be on Chinese menus.  There was a lot of hard work behind the scenes but now the deal is done it  could potentially be worth over &pound;50 million to Britain&rsquo;s pig industry. </p>
<p class="newsbody">If you&rsquo;re worried that there might now be fewer British  bangers or bacon rashers on the shelves, don&rsquo;t fret. Much of the exported pork  will be ears, trotters and other piggy parts which British diners don&rsquo;t  generally eat but Chinese diners love. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Looks like it&rsquo;s win-win for everyone. </p>
