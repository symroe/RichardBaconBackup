<p class="artsub" style="text-align:justify; margin-top:15pt"> South Norfolk MP Richard 
  Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Fears  are being raised again that Chinese lanterns are a serious fire risk to  property and arable crops as well as being dangerous to farm animals. New calls  are being made for Chinese lanterns to be banned.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Early  last year I wrote to the then Minister at the Department for Business,  Innovation and Skills to raise the concerns of many farmers in South Norfolk as  to the hazards posed by these lanterns.&nbsp; Then last September I raised the  matter at Prime Minister&rsquo;s Questions where I was assured that the government  was contacting lantern manufacturers to demand that the lanterns should carry  full safety instructions and be 100 per cent biodegradable.</p>
<p class="newsbody">However,  I am still hearing about fires taking place, putting crops and property at  risk. I have now written to ministers to raise these concerns and to ask what  action the government has taken so far and what further steps are planned.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong><span class="artsub">Long Stratton Police Station</span></strong><br>
    Many  people travelling through Long Stratton on the A140 will have seen the  village&rsquo;s impressive new police station, which I was recently invited to visit  by Sergeant Tim Chapman.&nbsp; It is a striking building with modern office  space, an interview room and a crew room for local paramedics who use the  station as a base.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The  locker room was full of crime-fighting kit, even including riot gear, and I was  surprised to learn that Sergeant Chapman goes up to Coltishall periodically to  practise having petrol bombs thrown at him!</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong><span class="artsub">High Speed Tour</span></strong><br>
  Group  Lotus is one of the largest employers in South Norfolk.&nbsp; Over the last  year I have repeatedly urged Business Secretary Vince Cable to visit Lotus  personally to see for himself the company&rsquo;s extraordinary work, both as a car  manufacturer and as an engineering adviser to many of the world&rsquo;s major motor  corporations.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">So  I was extremely pleased that earlier this week Vince finally paid a visit to  the Lotus headquarters, to hear about the company&rsquo;s exciting plans, including  the new range of cars planned for the next four years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lotus are  leading the way with hybrid cars using the latest fuel cell and battery  technology, which will have much wider use than just for sports cars.&nbsp; I  hope that company&rsquo;s relatively small voluntary redundancy programme will prove  a blip on an exciting upward path for Lotus.&nbsp; Certainly, Vince showed no  signs of slowing down when he drove a Lotus Evora on the new test track!</p>
