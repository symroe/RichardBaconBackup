<p class="artsub"><strong>HORSEMEAT SCANDAL</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">Many of you will have been shocked to learn that 100 percent  of the meat content in some ready meals has been found to come from  horses.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">So many contractors and sub-contractors are involved, it&rsquo;s  very difficult to trace where the horsemeat first entered the food chain.&nbsp;  Small wonder that shoppers are worried.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Regular readers will know that I have campaigned for better  food labelling for many years.&nbsp; Now the scandal of horsemeat in processed  meat products has reignited this debate.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">It&rsquo;s completely unacceptable that mislabelled meat has  entered the UK food chain.&nbsp; Processed meat products must have clearer  labelling so that consumers know exactly what&rsquo;s in them, including the species  from which the meat came.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">If you&rsquo;re in any doubt, look for the red tractor mark and  Buy British!&nbsp; </p>
<p class="artsub"><strong>RAIL </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you that Norfolk has struggled to  get its infrastructure updated for the 21st Century.&nbsp; The  county&rsquo;s MPs have been fighting hard for much-needed improvements.</p>
<p class="newsbody">After successes with the A11 dualling and Norfolk&rsquo;s  broadband network, attention is turning to the railways.&nbsp;&nbsp; Network  Rail recently published its investment plans for 2014-2019.&nbsp; Although the  plans aspire to make journeys from Diss to London quicker, they don&rsquo;t commit to  achieving this.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The plans need at least to make a five-minute cut in journey  times by 2019 and build extra tracks to ease the bottleneck around Chelmsford  and outer London.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;ve called on the Transport Secretary and the Rail  Regulator to ensure that Network Rail commits to making these changes by 2019.</p>
<p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;ll let you know what they say.</p>
<p class="artsub"><strong>MATERNITY SERVICES</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">The National Audit Office are reviewing NHS maternity  services and they&rsquo;ve asked me to help them find out what new mums think.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">If you&rsquo;ve recently used the NHS&rsquo;s maternity services, or if  you work in the NHS, then I want to hear from you.&nbsp; This is your chance to  share your experiences and shape an important national review of how maternity  services are performing.&nbsp;&nbsp; MPs will use this report to hold NHS  bosses to account.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">If you would like to share your experiences, good or bad,  then please do get in touch.&nbsp; You can email me at <a href="mailto:inquiries@richardbacon.org.uk" class="tsb">inquiries@richardbacon.org.uk</a>,  putting &lsquo;maternity services&rsquo; in the subject line and including your full  contact details and the name of the hospital you are writing about.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="artsub"><span class="newsbody">All submissions will be treated in the strictest confidence</span>. </p>
