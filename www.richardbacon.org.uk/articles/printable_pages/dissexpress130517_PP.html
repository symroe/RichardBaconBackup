  Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p><span class="artsub">RAIL IMPROVEMENTS</span><br>
  <span class="newsbody">Our local rail operator,  Greater Anglia, recently asked me what improvements in their services should be  high on the list between now and 2016.&nbsp; Greater Anglia already has new  rolling stock as a top priority so this was an opportunity to bang the drum for  other improvements.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="newsbody">My reply urged Greater Anglia  to protect and improve services from Diss station.&nbsp; I also called for the  journey between Norwich and London to be made quicker without cutting the  number of station stops in between.&nbsp; The seat reservation service also  needs improvement so that reserved seats are marked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;m pleased that Greater  Anglia is looking for feedback from its passengers.&nbsp; If any Diss Express  readers have any suggestions which I can pass on to Greater Anglia, please let  me know at <a href="mailto:richardbaconmp@parliament.uk" class="tsb">richardbaconmp@parliament.uk</a>. <br>
</p>
<p><span class="artsub">SELF-BUILD LAUNCH</span> <br>
    <span class="newsbody">Yesterday I chaired the  launch of a new report by the University of York and Lloyds Bank on the future  of Self-Build housing. Self-Build is a small sector in the UK - in fact, much  smaller than most of our continental neighbours. Examples from self-build  projects in Germany and the Netherlands show it is not just wealthy people who  can benefit.&nbsp; Whole communities can use self-build as a way of addressing  the shortage in affordable houses without resorting to volume-built estates  with no sense of identity. </span></p>
<p class="newsbody">We can do much more in this  area, helping to solve the housing crisis while protecting our cherished  environment. That is why I am also launching a new All-Party Parliamentary  Group on Self Build and Independent Housebuilding.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The UK&rsquo;s self-build market is  small, but it has great potential.&nbsp; It is encouraging that a mortgage  provider with Lloyds&rsquo; clout is looking at self-build seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class="artsub"><a name="diss"></a>LOCALISM</span> <br>
    <span class="newsbody">Diss Town Coucil and its  Clerk and her team do a sterling job for Diss.&nbsp; The Council has a very  clear idea of our town&rsquo;s potential and it works closely with local business  partners to make Diss a lovely place to live. </span></p>
<p class="newsbody">However, I want keen to see  capable town councils like Diss get the power to do more for their  residents.&nbsp; Central government needs to get out of the way of local  councils.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The localism agenda offers so  many opportunities for innovative, energetic town councils like  Diss.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the Government to help our town to do more and, now  Parliament has returned, I will be talking to ministers with that aim in  mind.&nbsp;</p>
