Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">HARLESTON NATIONWIDE</span> <br>
  Nationwide Building Society&rsquo;s decision to close its branch  in Harleston has rightly attracted much dismay in the town.&nbsp; Following on  from the closure of HSBC, residents are determined not to let another financial  institution close its doors locally without a fight.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">I recently met local business leaders who left me in no  doubt about the strength of local feeling and Nationwide bosses need to  understand just how important the branch is to Harleston. Together with local  business leaders, I am hoping to meet Nationwide in the near future to ask them  to review this decision. </p>
<p class="newsbody">I hope that Nationwide&rsquo;s bosses can be persuaded to change  their mind, but keeping the branch open will certainly be an uphill  struggle.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, if you&rsquo;re a customer of the Harleston  Nationwide, please do keep on using the branch. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">PYLONS &amp; THE WAVENEY</span> <br>
  There is renewed concern about National Grid&rsquo;s plans to  connect cables from offshore windfarms to the electricity network, especially  because one possible option is to put pylons along the Waveney  Valley.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Readers may recall that last year I met National Grid at  Wortwell Community Centre together with hundreds of Waveney Valley residents,  and representatives from local parish councils, to talk about such a  possibility.&nbsp; There was a strong and united front against the idea.&nbsp;  We left National Grid in no doubt that pylons have no place in the Waveney  Valley and that any attempt to proceed would face the fiercest  opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">I am keeping a close eye on this issue and I will be pressing home  the case for undergrounding any lines coming through Norfolk. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="artsub">A GRAND OCCASION</span><br>
  I wanted to finish my column this month by congratulating  the people of Diss and the wider area for the magnificent reception they gave  to the First Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment&nbsp;earlier this month. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The crowd&rsquo;s respect and affection for the Vikings was very  clear, and the turnout - especially compared to much larger towns where the  Royal Anglians have paraded, such as Ipswich and Peterborough - was quite  exceptional.&nbsp; It meant the occasion really felt like a family  affair.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">At a civic reception afterwards, I chatted to members of  the Regiment who were quite obviously overwhelmed by the warmth of their  reception.</p>
<p class="newsbody">This was a grand occasion, at which I was honoured to be  present.&nbsp; Diss did the Regiment proud and my heartiest thanks go out to  everyone involved.</p>
