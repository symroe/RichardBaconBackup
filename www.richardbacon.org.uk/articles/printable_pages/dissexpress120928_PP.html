Bacon brings <i>Diss Express</i> readers up to date with some of his recent work in the community.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> <span class="bigword6"><strong><u>AMBULANCE  CHANGES</u></strong></span><br>
  There is  growing concern over changes to the way ambulances will respond to 999  calls.&nbsp; In future, there will be more paramedics in &lsquo;rapid response  vehicles&rsquo; rather than traditional ambulances.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">Under the  plans, Diss will lose one of its two ambulances but gain a rapid response  vehicle.&nbsp; Ambulances will still be needed to take people to hospital, but  this means paramedics could be caring for a patient for some time before an  ambulance arrives.&nbsp; That puts both the patient and the paramedic under  considerable stress.&nbsp;&nbsp; There may be good reasons for these changes  but they certainly could have been better explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">I&rsquo;m going to  meet with Hayden Newton, Chief Executive of the Ambulance Trust soon and put  these points to him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let you know what he has to say.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody"> <span class="bigword6"><strong><u>VINCES  ROAD</u></strong></span><br>
  Businesses on  Vinces Road are getting increasingly fed up with the queues at the junction  with Victoria Road. &nbsp;Customers and employees can often sit waiting in  their cars for up to 30 minutes to leave the estate at the mini roundabout.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not only is this frustrating for drivers who want to go home, it&rsquo;s also far  from being a good advert for the town. &nbsp;And there is no easy solution,  since public money is not available to improve the junction&nbsp;right now.  &nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">I have  contacted the County Council and South Norfolk Council to ask them to take  another look at the problem. Something needs to be done but making the junction  manageable in the short-term will require flexibility from everyone concerned.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> <span class="bigword6"><strong><u>RURAL  HOUSING WEEK</u></strong></span><br>
  By the time you  read this, we will be coming to the end of Rural Housing Week, which takes  place between 24 and 30 September 2012&nbsp;in the East of England.&nbsp;  During the week, housing associations are working to raise awareness  of&nbsp;the need for&nbsp;housing in&nbsp;small towns and&nbsp;villages.</p>
<p class="newsbody">I have always  believed in putting small housing developments into many parishes across the  constituency rather than having a handful of very large developments.&nbsp;  This gives young people and new families a chance to stay in their local area  when they might otherwise be priced out.&nbsp; Small developments can also help  to keep open the village shop, post office and local pub.</p>
<p class="newsbody">I visited a new  Saffron Housing development in the Pulhams yesterday and I hope that Rural  Housing Week will provide a much-needed boost for similar developments across  the region.&nbsp;</p>
