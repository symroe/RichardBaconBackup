  <b>The arrest of Damian Green is a catastrophe which affects every MP.  It also raises exceptionally serious questions about the behaviour of the police, the actions of both ministers and senior civil servants in the Home Office and the conduct of the Speaker of the House of Commons.</b></p>		
  <p class="articlebody" style="MARGIN-left:0pt">
  <b>The right to oppose the government of the day is vastly more important than 
    which political party happens to hold office.</b></p> 
		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>

		  If Damian Green 
		  were suspected of murdering someone, there would be no objection to 
		  gathering evidence where ever necessary.&nbsp; But this is not the case.&nbsp; He 
		  is an effective Opposition politician who has exposed facts which the 
		  government of the day finds embarrassing and which the public has a 
		  right to know.&nbsp; Ministers say they were kept in the dark about Green&#8217;s 
		  arrest.&nbsp; This is barely credible but if it is true then what were civil 
		  servants up to?&nbsp; Sir David Normington, the permanent under-secretary at 
		  the Home Office, is in the firing line because he should not have 
		  triggered the police investigation.&nbsp; And the police &#8211; in the person of 
		  Sir Paul Stephenson, the acting head of the Met Police &#8211; should have 
		  refused Normington&#8217;s request, telling him that leaks of unclassified 
		  documents were not a matter for the police.</b></p>

		  Neither seems to 
		  have understood that we don&#8217;t do political arrests in this country and 
		  that the legitimate job of the Opposition &#8211; paid for by taxpayers &#8211; is 
		  to annoy the government and hold it to account.&nbsp; The fact that civil 
		  servants thought ministers being annoyed was a reason to call in the 
		  police is bad enough.&nbsp; The fact that the <i>police</i> should think that 
		  ministers and senior civil servants being annoyed was enough to warrant 
		  police action is truly alarming.&nbsp; Stephenson has shown that he lacks 
		  sound judgement.</b></p>

		  What is worst of 
		  all &#8211; profoundly shocking &#8211; is that the police should search an MP&#8217;s 
		  office looking for material given to that MP by civil servants.&nbsp; In 
		  common with other MPs, I have been sent material by civil servants which 
		  it was in the public interest for everyone to know about.&nbsp; As a member 
		  of the public accounts committee, I was sent a dossier in 2006 by a 
		  civil servant who was distressed that foreign workers were abusing the 
		  tax credit system to buy homes abroad.&nbsp; The insider sent me documentary 
		  evidence that immigrants from eastern Europe were coming to the UK, 
		  taking low-paid jobs and then applying for tax credits.&nbsp; Once the claim 
		  had been set up, the fraudsters were returning to their home country but 
		  the tax credit payments continued to be paid into their bank accounts.&nbsp; 
		  They then used the money to buy property in eastern Europe. Meanwhile, 
		  the experienced anti-fraud teams in HM Revenue and Customs who could 
		  have helped the situation were being made redundant to meet government 
		  efficiency targets.</b></p>

		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>
		  I passed on the 
		  material to the National Audit Office for investigation but I would not 
		  have tolerated the police snooping around my office looking for it, 
		  which would have exposed the civil servant in question.&nbsp; It is paramount 
		  that MPs can hold information without fearing a knock on the door from 
		  the police. </b></p>

		  What is truly 
		  surprising in this episode is that the Speaker of the House of Commons 
		  allowed the search of an MP&#8217;s office to take place.&nbsp; I cannot accept 
		  that this was the correct decision.&nbsp; It leaves me wondering how I can 
		  have any confidence that the Speaker would defend my right as a Member 
		  of Parliament to hold sensitive information without the fear of a police 
		  raid.</b></p>

		  If the Speaker 
		  knew about the proposed raid and gave clearance for it, he made a 
		  dreadful mistake.&nbsp; If he didn&#8217;t know about the raid until it was too 
		  late to stop it, then he still failed to defend the rights of MPs.&nbsp; I 
		  have a sinking feeling that the Speaker has let us down in something of 
		  incalculable importance and that it is now hard to see what he is there 
		  for.</b></p>

		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>
		  We have to know 
		  how this happened: exactly <i>who</i> gave permission for the raid on 
		  Damian Green&#8217;s office at Westminster?&nbsp; The police would not have taken 
		  this action without permission. </b></p>
		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>
		  &nbsp;</b></p>
		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>
		  The only certain 
		  fact is that the raid occurred.&nbsp; It seems unlikely that the granting of 
		  permission for a police raid would have been the unaided decision of the 
		  Serjeant-at-Arms, Jill Pay.&nbsp; She is a servant of the Speaker and would 
		  not have had authority to give permission without consulting either the 
		  Speaker or the Clerk of the House.</b></p>
		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>
		  &nbsp;</b></p>
		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>
		  The position of 
		  the Clerk of the House, Malcolm Jack, is central. Either the Clerk of 
		  the House <i>was</i> consulted and he advised that the raid should be 
		  permitted; or he was consulted and he advised that it was <i>not</i> 
		  permissible but he was ignored; or he was not consulted.&nbsp; If he was not 
		  consulted this would beg two questions: Why not? And why hasn&#8217;t he said 
		  so? </b></p>
		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>
		  &nbsp;</b></p>
		<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="articlebody"><b>
		  The basic premise 
		  must be that the Clerk of the House would have been consulted by the 
		  Speaker.&nbsp; If this is the case, then either the Speaker went against the 
		  advice of the Clerk of the House, which is difficult to believe, or the 
		  Clerk of the House advised that the raid was permissible.&nbsp; The logic of 
		  the position is that the Clerk of the House was consulted and advised 
		  that the raid was acceptable.&nbsp; And it wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; So his position may be in 
		  doubt.</b></p>

		  The Leader of the 
		  House of Commons, Harriet Harman, appears to understand the magnitude of 
		  what has happened.&nbsp; Senior Labour Party figures such as David Blunkett 
		  and others have also expressed their disquiet.&nbsp; Our political system can 
		  only operate if there is agreement between the parties on certain 
		  fundamentals.&nbsp; One of these is that those in government do not use the

		  The Sessional

		  This means something.&nbsp; It is of course true that so long as the 
		  government commands a majority in the Commons it should get its business 
		  after due debate.&nbsp; But on Wednesday, before we debate the Queen&#8217;s Speech 
		  &#8211; which is after all just one legislative programme of one particular 
		  government &#8211; we will need to debate something of much more fundamental
