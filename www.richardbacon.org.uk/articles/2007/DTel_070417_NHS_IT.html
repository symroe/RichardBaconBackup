		<p class="artsub" style="text-autospace: none">As 
		civil servants prepare for a new government after the departure of Tony 
		Blair, they could do worse than put signs above the door of every 
		minister's office: &#8220;Beware the <i>grand projet</i>!&#8221; Never would 
		this advice have been more apt than for the most expensive health 
		technology project in history, the national programme for IT in the NHS.</p>
		<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">In this case, 
		hyperbole is appropriate. The project is costing more than £12 billion, 
		enough to pay for 60,000 nurses for 10 years, or for Britain's 
		participation in Iraq and Afghanistan twice over.</p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">Run by an 
				agency called Connecting for Health, the vision (are you nervous 
				yet?) is to link up the entire NHS for the electronic age. 
				Patient records are to be available electronically to all 
				clinicians, while appointments and admissions will be booked 
				online and drugs prescribed electronically. The blueprint was a 
				document published in 2002 called Delivering 21st Century IT 
				Support for the NHS. Any senior mandarin who was awake should 
				have started worrying then, since the published version of this 
				document strangely omitted both the high risk scoring and the 
				costs estimate included in the draft - then a mere £5&nbsp;billion, 
				although the latest figure has more than doubled.</p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">By now, 
				almost every hospital in England is supposed to have key 
				administrative software deployed as the essential first step in 
				introducing the shiny new electronic patient record. They are 
				miles behind schedule, yet the limited deployment has already 
				caused havoc, with significant delays in providing inoculations 
				to children, waiting list breaches, missing patient records and 
				the inability to report activity statistics. Not to mention the 
				trifling matter of the largest computer crash in NHS history, 
				when 80 hospitals had no access to patient administration 
				systems for four days. </p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">
		This is a truly grim tale. More than £2 billion has been spent, and 
		although there is no detailed record of overall expenditure on the 
		programme, estimates of its total cost have ranged from £6.2&nbsp;billion up 
		to £20 billion. There have been six bosses in five years. Timetables are 
		fictitious and the programme is now years behind.</p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">
		Doctors, nurses and hospital managers have been left spitting with rage. 
		Most GPs think the appointment booking system is a joke. And three 
		fifths of the programme is dependent on a software supplier called 
		iSoft, which is currently under investigation by the Financial Services 
		Authority and whose flagship software product, &#8220;Lorenzo&#8221;, does not 
		exist yet (even though the company said it was available three years 
		ago). In the meantime, iSoft has been merrily selling old software that 
		pre-dates the national programme.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">
		Today, Parliament&#8217;s spending watchdog publishes a report on this 
		multi-billion-pound fiasco, which concludes: &#8220;At the present rate of 
		progress, it is unlikely that significant clinical benefits will be 
		delivered by the end of the contract period&#8221;. The whole project has 
		been an object lesson in how not do it. There are some basic rules of 
		thumb that apply to successful IT projects: start small, do it in 
		stages, learn from your mistakes, resist the grand vision thing, scale 
		up only when you know what you are doing, and - above all - talk to the 
		people who will use it.</p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">
		Instead, the NHS started with a series of enormous contracts, about 
		£1 billion each, which were let with indecent haste, before 
		talking to clinicians and without knowing what they wanted. One expert 
		told our committee: &#8220;It was like being in a juggernaut lorry going up 
		the M1 and it did not really matter where you went as long as you 
		arrived somewhere on time. Then, when you had arrived somewhere, you 
		would go out and buy a product, but you were not quite sure what you 
		wanted to buy. To be honest, I do not think the people selling it knew 
		what we needed&#8221;.</p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">The 
		result was a set of contracts that were signed before the Government 
		knew what it wanted to buy and before the suppliers knew what it was 
		they were expected to supply. Subsequently, we have a project that is 
		costing a fortune, that most people in the health service don't want and 
		that doesn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">If 
		Connecting for Health had been created by one of this country's enemies 
		with the specific task of wasting as much money as possible while 
		causing maximum anger and resentment among doctors, nurses and hospital 
		managers, it could hardly have done a better job. Having been given 
		responsibility for the largest sum of money ever allocated to a health 
		IT programme anywhere in the world, at least £12.4 billion, which 
		incidentally dwarfs the entire NHS deficit, it has failed to deliver.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">
		This disastrous agency should be put out of its misery, but most of its 
		budget - £10 billion is still unspent - and its purchasing 
		functions should be handed over to local hospital bosses. Any remaining 
		functions could be handled by the Department of Health directly. IT has 
		a tremendous role to play in healthcare and it saves lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		</p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">One 
		size does not fit all. The obvious solution is something similar to that 
		which worked very well for GPs in the mid-1990s. Hospitals should be 
		allowed to choose the systems they want, provided that those systems 
		meet national standards. The role of the centre should be confined to 
		setting those standards and allocating budgets. Hospital chief 
		executives should have the freedom to buy what they want for their 
		hospital, in consultation with their own clinicians and also be given 
		contractual responsibility for delivering it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
				<p class="articlebody" style="text-autospace: none">
		This approach would not only deliver more products more quickly - it 
		would also save a fortune, which the next prime minister will wish to 
		note well.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
