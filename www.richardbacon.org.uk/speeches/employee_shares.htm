			House of Commons on 18 January 2002</cite></div>
		&nbsp;<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon	(South Norfolk):</b> I shall be brief. I want to make two or three 
		points, if I can remove the frog from my throat. It has become 
		fashionable in my party to have a frog in the throat, and I am trying to 
		adopt the style of the Front Bench. I shall also try to make myself 
		understood. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Many constituents 
		have written to me about employee share ownership, including eight 
		partners in the John Lewis Partnership. I am delighted to support the 
		Bill. The John Lewis Partnership has several excellent stores in my 
		area, including Bonds, a department store in Norwich, and two branches 
		of Waitrose, one of which is in my constituency. They provide a superb 
		service to local people in Norfolk as well as employment for several 
		hundred people. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Joe Mooney, one 
		of my constituents who is a partner in the John Lewis Partnership, 
		wrote: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;I believe the John Lewis Partnership is a 
				successful retailer because it is owned by its employees, who 
				care about the development of their business today and for 
				future generations. 
				The Bill - &quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">which he has asked me to support: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;is seeking not only to make it easier for 
				companies to become employee-owned, but also to improve the 
				position of existing employee-owned companies. These 
				improvements will include tax exemptions on shares given to 
				employees by their company.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">It seems odd that 
		companies such as Asda and Tesco -competitors of the John Lewis 
		Partnership - are able to take advantage of those tax exemptions in 
		helping their employees, while good firms such as the John Lewis 
		Partnership are not. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have 
		referred to the John Lewis brief, and asked whether it would be possible 
		in practice for the company to provide liquidity to an internal market 
		for the shares. I think that, with 55,000 employees across the country, 
		that ought to be possible. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The hon. Member for 
		Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), who is no longer in his place - I dare 
		say he has gone off to write his press release, or to find another use for the 1p 
		- made the point that part-time 
		employees can play a long-term role in a company. I think that that is 
		right, and there is no reason why these problems should not be sorted 
		out in Committee. We ought all to unite in supporting the principle in 
		the Bill of wider employee share ownership. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I confess to having a 
		lot of sympathy with the criticisms made of the actions of my party in 
		the 1980s in introducing schemes that benefited only some, rather than 
		all, employees. Manifestly, something that is introduced because it is 
		of benefit to certain classes of employee ought, by its very nature, to 
		be available to all employees. The former head of the Prime Minister's 
		policy unit looks as though he wishes to intervene. I give way to him.
		</p>
		<b>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. David Miliband 
		(South Shields):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman share my pleasure in an 
		example of a change of attitude in South Shields? It exemplifies the 
		shift that he has talked about, from rewarding only those at the top of 
		the company to rewarding everyone throughout. For 11 weeks last autumn, 
		a major employer in my constituency was in receivership. During that 
		time, a management buy-out team was brought together and I am delighted 
		to say that in December a new company, Circatex, was launched. The first 
		thing that the new management did was to introduce a 30 per cent. 
		employee share ownership scheme for the new company, as a way of showing 
		their commitment to the employees and saying that they were there for 
		the long term. They wanted to reward the employees, many of whom had 
		been with the company for 10 or 20 years, and make them part of the 
		company's future. Does the hon. Gentleman hope, as I do, that that 
		represents a change of attitude for significant parts of British 
		management, as well as for those in the House? </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I agree with the 
		hon. Gentleman that that is representative of the change in attitude. In 
		fact, there has been a sea change in attitudes generally. I enjoyed what 
		I might almost call the Thatcherite speech by the hon. Member for West 
		Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey). I used to go to West Bromwich as a small 
		boy to watch its football team; it did not seem to be a bastion of 
		Thatcherism in the late 70s. In fact, I joined the Conservative party 
		because of Red Robbo, whom I am sure the hon. Gentleman remembers well.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">There has been a 
		change in attitudes, and that is most welcome. It is extraordinary that 
		anyone should suppose that these incentives would not be sought by all 
		kinds of employees, and I am very pleased to support the principle of 
		the Bill. We have nothing to fear from diverse forms of capital 
		ownership. That could mean ordinary shareholding in the traditional 
		western capitalist sense. I am delighted to see my hon. Friend the 
		Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) here in full 
		battle dress. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Mark Field 
		(Cities of London and Westminster):</b> I think the full battle dress 
		will appear after lunch. My hon. Friend will be glad to know that my 
		luncheon activities are being catered for. May I also say that I very 
		much agree with the Bill? It seems that the John Lewis Partnership's employees around the country have 
		been lobbying us all furiously, because I, too, have had at least half a 
		dozen letters from a similar source. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I have noticed that, 
		any time after about 4 o'clock, the likelihood is that I shall find my 
		hon. Friend in a dinner jacket, limbering up for his evening activities, 
		usually with the King of Jordan or somebody like that. The rest of us 
		have to slum it in the Terrace caff. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We have nothing to 
		fear from diverse forms of capital ownership. That could mean ordinary 
		share owning, co-operatives, employee trusts or mutuals. I acted for a 
		mutual building society for some months; I was seconded to it three days 
		a week. Hon. Members may remember when the Britannia building society 
		faced a most unwelcome challenge from a demutualisation campaign. If 
		anyone doubts the benefits of what is sometimes described as the 
		nebulous trade known as public relations, I would refer them to the 
		photographs that occasionally appeared in the tabloid newspapers of that 
		mad butler, Mr. Michael Hardern, wearing a dress, under the rather 
		suggestive headline: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;This is the nutter who wants to run your 
				savings.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That alone justifies 
		the existence of the public relations industry, because that campaign 
		helped to ensure that the Britannia, now the nation's second largest 
		building society, thrives to this day as a conscientious local employer 
		in regions across the country, and one that takes great pride in being 
		involved in the community. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Reference was made 
		earlier to the business of profit-related pay, and to its being 
		discredited. I have not examined the issue in detail, but it would not 
		surprise me if it had not worked as well as it was supposed to because, 
		in a funny sort of way, this question is not mainly about money. Money 
		is obviously important, but this is mainly about people having control 
		over their own lives. The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Miliband) 
		referred to the company in his constituency. In a previous incarnation, 
		I used to write about management buy-outs and management consultants 
		helping companies that were on the brink to climb out of that position. 
		Nearly always, the solution involved drawing in the entire work force 
		and making them work with one purpose towards success. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Love: </b>Does 
		the hon. Gentleman agree that we will really have seen the revolution 
		that people have been talking about today when companies that are not on 
		the brink of bankruptcy or in financial difficulties involve their 
		employees, without the spur that bankruptcy provides? </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I could not agree 
		more with the hon. Gentleman. I find it difficult to understand why 
		managers would ever think of introducing an executive share option 
		scheme that would be available only to them and those close to them, and 
		not to everyone else. The Government should seriously consider ways of 
		making it more beneficial for companies to have schemes that involve 
		everyone, rather than involving only some employees. I would be strongly 
		in favour of that. The principle of employee share ownership deserves 
		the widest support on both sides of the House, and the Bill definitely 
		deserves a Second Reading.<br>
