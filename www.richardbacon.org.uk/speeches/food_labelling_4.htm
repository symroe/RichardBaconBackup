        <p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) 
          (Con):</b> I beg to move,</p>
        <p class="speechquote">That leave be given to bring in a 
          Bill to amend the Food Labelling Regulations 1996 to provide 
          for information about the country of origin of food to be 
          made available to consumers; and for connected purposes.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">Many Members from across the House have attempted to improve the 
          law on food labelling, including my hon. Friends the Members for 
          Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien), and for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. 
          Pickles), and the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Helen 
          Southworth). This is my third attempt, and I keep going because 
          there is widespread support for the idea that consumers should 
          have clearer, more accurate and more honest information about 
          the food that they buy.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">My Bill has the support of Members across the House and is 
          intended to deal with one particularly pernicious problem in 
          relation to food labelling, which is that consumers buying meat 
          and meat products are routinely misled as to the country of 
          origin due to inadequate and even deceptive labelling. The 
          European directive 2000/13/EC relating to the labelling of food 
          makes it clear that</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;The prime consideration for any rules 
          on the labelling of foodstuffs should be the need to inform 
          and protect the consumer.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="speechbody">It goes on to state:</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;Detailed labelling...is the most 
          appropriate since it creates fewest obstacles to free 
          trade&#8221;,</p>
        <p class="speechbody">and that</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;The rules on labelling should 
          also prohibit the use of information that would mislead 
          the purchaser&#8221;.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">The British rules on food labelling are set out in 
          regulation 5 of the Food Labelling Regulations 1996, which 
          were introduced prior to the European directive, but which 
          cover much the same ground. This states that all food to 
          which the regulations apply</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;shall be marked or labelled with 
          . . . particulars of the place of origin or provenance 
          of the food if failure to give such particulars might 
          mislead a purchaser to a material degree as to the true 
          origin or provenance of the food&#8221;.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">One could be forgiven for thinking that the law was already 
          quite clear and sufficient. Unfortunately, that is not the 
          case and consumers continue to be misled.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">On some foodstuffs no indication is given at all that the 
          product is made with imported meat, such as the label on a 
          Tesco chicken dinner in a range of children&#8217;s meals, which 
          simply states &#8220;Produced in the UK&#8221;, when the chicken 
          actually comes from Thailand. Sometimes a phrase will be 
          used to imply country of origin&#8212;for example, the Birds Eye 
          Great British Menu range, which on closer examination turns 
          out to be made with imported meat. Sometimes the label will 
          be deliberately vague, as in the case of Sainsbury&#8217;s roast 
          chicken slices, which the label describes as</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;Produced from Brazilian or 
          British Chicken&#8221;.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">At present producers of imported meat can lawfully use the 
          Union flag on packaging to imply that the product is British 
          when it is not, and they do so. Marks and Spencer has been 
          selling a corned beef sandwich as part of its &#8220;nation&#8217;s 
          favourites&#8221; range with a Union flag that dominates the whole 
          of the front of the label. In small letters on the back is 
          the information that the beef 
          comes from Brazil. To its credit, Marks and Spencer has now 
          recognised that customers may have been misled and is taking 
          steps to repackage the product. That still raises the 
          question why Marks and Spencer used the Union flag in the 
          first place. There is a widespread problem. Consumers are 
          being misled.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">The aim of the European directive&#8212;to ensure that the rules 
          prohibit the use of information that would mislead the 
          purchaser&#8212;is not being met. The aim of the UK&#8217;s own food 
          labelling regulations, which call for place of origin 
          labelling if failure to provide this might mislead a 
          purchaser, is not being met. There is clear evidence that 
          consumers want more information, and indeed consumers have a 
          right to know. An ICM poll for the honest food campaign 
          showed that 87 per cent. of consumers in the survey believe 
          the Government should ensure that the country of origin is 
          clearly shown on food products, and 89 per cent. believe 
          that a product such as sausages or bacon labelled as 
          &#8220;British&#8221; or &#8220;Produced in the UK&#8221; should mean that the 
          sausages or bacon are from an animal reared in Britain.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural 
          Affairs said in January:</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;A pork pie made in Britain from 
          Danish pork can legitimately be labelled as a British 
          pork pie.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="speechbody">He added:</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;That&#8217;s a nonsense, and it needs 
          to change.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="speechbody">I agree, as does the Minister with responsibility for 
          farming, the Minister of State, Department for Environment, 
          Food and Rural Affairs, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, 
          Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), whom I am delighted to see in her 
          place, and who is going down very well with farmers in my 
          constituency. She recently appeared on the excellent 
          programme on Channel 4, &#8220;Jamie Saves Our Bacon&#8221;, and told 
          Jamie Oliver that misleading labelling was &#8220;a disgrace&#8221;, and 
          I agree.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">The right hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and 
          Wallsend (Mr. Brown), was an Agriculture Minister 10 years 
          ago, and I am delighted to see him, too, in his place. He 
          told the House in 1999:</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;I want to give clear, unambiguous 
          information on the real place of origin, not place of 
          processing or place of slicing; I want to clamp down on 
          misleading place of origin descriptions; and I want to 
          make further progress by lobbying the European 
          Commission and other member states for a system of clear 
          country of origin labelling.&#8221;&#8212;[<i> Official Report</i>, 
          28 October 1999; Vol. 336, c. 1126.]</p>
        <p class="speechbody">There is long-standing cross-party support for my Bill.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">On 31 October last year, just two days after my last Food 
          Labelling Bill, the Food Standards Agency updated its food 
          labelling guidance to include advice on country of origin 
          labelling, which is welcome. The FSA acknowledges that</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;many consumers see the place of 
          origin as an important contributor to a product&#8217;s 
          identity, particularly for meat&#8221;.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">However, the FSA best practice guidance is not mandatory and 
          the FSA merely describes its guidance as</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;some suggestions that businesses 
          may wish to consider&#8221;.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">Well, they may, or they may not, but it is clear that the 
          new guidance has not prevented the abuses that I described a 
          moment ago, which were found in the shops just last month. 
          The FSA guidance recommends that Norwegian salmon smoked in 
          Scotland should not be called &#8220;Scottish smoked salmon&#8221;, but 
          that is not compulsory and the danger remains that consumers 
          will be misled.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">Country of origin labelling will also benefit food safety. 
          Retailers did their best to withdraw Irish pork products 
          during December&#8217;s dioxin scare, but packaging for Irish pork 
          processed anywhere in the UK does not have to state &#8220;made 
          with Irish pork&#8221;, and it could still have been bought by 
          unwary shoppers. Clear, mandatory country of origin food 
          labelling would have stopped that happening.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">There is no shortage of agreement that there is a problem; 
          the question is what we do about it. My conclusion is that 
          the time has come for honest food labelling to be made 
          compulsory. Some people say that legislation on country of 
          origin labelling would amount to a restriction on free 
          trade, but that is simply to misunderstand what consumer 
          choice is all about. It is very hard to see how providing 
          consumers with clear and unambiguous information about where 
          their food comes from could possibly be construed as 
          protectionist.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">More fully informed consumers do not protect particular 
          market participants or hinder the operation of a 
          marketplace&#8212;they make it work better. Some consumers wish 
          precisely to make choices based on the origins of food. 
          During the apartheid era, many people, finding apartheid 
          abhorrent, understandably wished to avoid buying fruit from 
          South Africa. Nowadays, people wish to know the origins of 
          food to support, through their spending choices, high animal 
          welfare standards or low food miles, for example.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">There is widespread support from farmers to chefs to animal 
          welfare bodies for better country of origin labelling. 
          Compassion in World Farming believes that meat and products 
          containing meat should be permitted to be labelled as 
          British only if the animal from which the meat was derived 
          was born, reared and slaughtered in Britain. The Royal 
          Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has said 
          that transparent labelling is vital in assisting consumers 
          to make informed choices. The honest food campaign is 
          supported by leading chefs such as Clarissa Dickson Wright, 
          Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Prue Leith and Rick Stein. My 
          Bill focuses on meat and meat products, because with them 
          lies the biggest problem of consumers being misled. The 
          British Pig Executive has described country of origin 
          labelling as a &#8220;key area for improvement&#8221;.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">There is some compulsory origin labelling already. A note 
          from Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, an international 
          organisation representing some 80 consumer bodies, made the 
          argument for my Bill rather well when it stated:</p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;The EU has no mandatory country 
          of origin labelling except for fruit, vegetables, beef, 
          fish, eggs and wine&#8221;&#8212;</p>
        <p class="speechbody">
          <!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Richard Bacon"-->
          <!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="782"-->
          it could have added honey and olive oil to the list. It is 
          time for clear country of origin labelling for all meat. It 
          is simplistic to suggest that consumers will automatically 
          buy British; the key point is that consumers should be able 
          to make an informed choice. Some consumers might want to buy 
          authentic Spanish chorizo or German Wurst because they like 
          the taste. That is their choice.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">In conclusion, we have been waiting for years for a workable 
          voluntary scheme for country of origin food labelling. The 
          time has come to accept that honest food labelling requires 
          the force of law. That is what consumers have the right to 
          expect, and that is what my Bill provides. I commend it to 
          the House.</p>
