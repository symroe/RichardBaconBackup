		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given on 14 December 2004 in Westminster Hall, as part of Richard's adjournment debate on the 
			financing of health services in Norfolk. </cite></div>
		<br>
		<br><div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South 
		Norfolk):</b> Mr.Deputy Speaker, it is a great pleasure to introduce the debate under your magnificent chairmanship, [Hon. Members: "Creep!"] Better to get one's creeping in first, eh? It is also a pleasure to speak about England's greatest county, particularly when so many hon. Members who represent Norfolk are here. Such occasions always seem festive, even when the subject is as serious as the one that we are about to discuss. I note that my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard) has even dressed in Christmas colours, and that some representatives of old Labour are present, too. </p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The debate is about the 
			financing of the health service in Norfolk, a serious subject. It 
			will be partly about the funding itself, and partly about the uses 
			of the funding and the pressure on it. At present, there is a 
			serious deficit in the Norfolk health economy. According to recent 
			figures supplied to me on 9 December by the Norfolk, Suffolk and 
			Cambridgeshire strategic health authority, national health service 
			bodies in Norfolk have forecast the following year-end positions in 
			their most recent financial returns. Norwich primary care trust 
			forecasts a deficit of just under £1.8 million. Southern Norfolk 
			primary care trust in my constituency forecasts a deficit of £9.2 
			million - a reflection of the fact that it is by far the largest 
			primary care trust in Norfolk. North Norfolk primary care trust 
			forecasts a deficit of £3.1 million, Broadland primary care trust 
			one of £4.8 million, and West Norfolk primary care trust one of £1.7 
			million.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Alone among the primary care trusts, Great Yarmouth PCT is running a more or less balanced position, with a small surplus of about £100,000. Perhaps that is a reflection of the extra money that goes into Yarmouth. I shall not say that that is attributable to the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright), although I am sure that he would like me to do so. There is no doubt, however, that Great Yarmouth is well funded compared with some of the other primary care trusts. Having projected a much bigger deficit earlier in the year, the Norfolk and Norwich hospital, our new flagship private finance initiative national health service trust, is now projecting a deficit of about £2 million. The Norfolk and Waveney mental health partnership has a break-even position. The King's Lynn and Wisbech NHS trust has a deficit of £7.9 million. The James Paget NHS trust, again in the constituency of the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth, has a break-even position and the East Anglian Ambulance national health service trust has a surplus of £750,000, although that is mainly due to a one-off asset sale of the ambulance station at Newmarket. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">The total deficit is about £29.7 million. That 
			includes the repayment of deficits from the previous year of £6.6 
			million, of which £5.2 million is at King's Lynn hospital. It is 
			worth noting that in each of the three previous financial 
			years; 1999/2000 to 2002/03. NHS bodies in Norfolk were in overall 
			balance. The financial problem is relatively new to Norfolk, but not 
			confined to the county—it is common throughout the national health 
			service. However, it might be worse in Norfolk than elsewhere, which 
			is an issue that I want the Minister to examine. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">I refer to an estimate based on board papers 
			published by the West Midlands strategic health authority. I&nbsp;commend 
			the Government on the number of board papers now available across 
			the country on the internet. If only central Government took the 
			same attitude to the most interesting information about Departments. 
			I&nbsp;certainly commend the Department for the guidance that it has 
			given health authorities, hospitals and PCTs on what information 
			should be made available to the public. At a meeting on 17 November, 
			a strategic health authority assessment of the national position was 
			that there was a deficit of £499 million in NHS organisations across 
			the country. A board paper notes that 75 primary care trusts and 73 
			NHS hospital or other trusts forecast deficits. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">One must acknowledge that the problems are 
			complex and that there are no simple headline answers, but it is not 
			enough for the NHS to say that it always needs more money, as more 
			money has being going into it. Plainly, in some areas, including 
			Norfolk, there has been a lack of tight management, which has led to 
			extra financial problems. An obvious example of where problems have 
			arisen, which has been widely referred to in the county, is the 
			learning difficulties pooled fund. In that case, it is possible that 
			managers took their eye off the ball, or, more probably, designed and 
			developed a service without having enough regard for what was 
			affordable in the context of all the other priorities. </p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Anthony D. Wright (Great Yarmouth)</b> 
			(Lab): I understood the hon. Gentleman's point about learning 
			difficulty services, but is it not true that the county council is 
			in charge of the financing of that service? The truth is that there 
			has been overspend in the past two years, and although that was not 
			down to the PCTs, in&nbsp;the end they had to pick up a proportion of the 
			tab, 55 per cent., I believe, without having had direct input into the 
			way in which the budget was run. </p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon </b>: The hon. Gentleman makes a 
			fair point. </p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b>Mrs. Gillian Shephard (South-West Norfolk)</b> 
			(Con): Of course services for people with learning difficulties 
			depend heavily on co-operation and on part-funding in social 
			services, but I remind the House that Norfolk social services 
			department is seriously underfunded because of the way in which the 
			present Government have dealt with the funding of rural shire 
			counties, because of the regulations that the Government have 
			imposed on all aspects of social services and because of the 
			Government's determination to ring-fence funds within social 
			services, which means that there is almost no flexibility. The hon. 
			Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) is absolutely right: the 
			problem in local government funding has been transferred to the 
			health services. </p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon </b>: I am grateful to my right 
			hon. Friend, and I agree with everything that she said. Of course, 
			the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth is right to say that one should 
			not blame the PCTs for the issue. The problem is complex, with some 
			of the roots lying in Government provision of funding to the shire 
			counties. There is also a more general problem relating to what the 
			hon. Gentleman says: with joint working and joint funding 
			arrangements, one has to make sure that the proper management is in 
			place. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">On a slightly separate subject, but one that 
			makes my point. I was in Northern Ireland recently looking into a 
			project for the Public Accounts Committee, and the person before us, 
			the accounting officer, was pleased to say in the first 30 seconds 
			of her evidence that her department was responsible for only 2 per 
			cent. of the budget that we were discussing and the other 98 per 
			cent. was funded by a series of other agencies and Government 
			bodies, yet it was she who had to account for it. The learning 
			difficulties pooled fund run by PCTs and social services was to some 
			degree an innovation; there is nothing quite the same elsewhere. 
			However, when joint or partnership working arrangements are made, 
			one has to be sure that one has adequate management arrangements in 
			place. I do not think that that has always been the case. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">When problems are identified it is not enough 
			simply to say that the NHS always needs more money. Although the 
			problems have complex causes, some of them are Government-inspired. 
			Equally, it is not enough for the Government to say, &quot;We've given 
			the NHS some more money; now let it get on with it,&quot; as if to 
			suggest that they have no responsibility for the extra pressures at 
			present. The truth is that the Government have imposed a whole 
			series of extra initiatives that have extra costs attached to them. 
			There is a complex interplay between the money provided and what the 
			Government insist that the NHS does with it. The Government are good 
			at willing the ends, but not necessarily the means, and some of 
			their initiatives are making life more difficult and expensive. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Perhaps the most striking such initiative is 
			the so-called &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, which is bringing about a series 
			of new pay arrangements, conditions and terms of employment for NHS 
			staff under one heading. I talked to a finance director in Norfolk 
			who said that </p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;we simply don't 
			know how much this is going to cost&quot;.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Paul Kemp, the finance director for Norfolk, 
			Suffolk and Cambridgeshire SHA, said that </p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;the main financial 
			risks are that the cost of Agenda for Change will exceed planning 
			assumptions, and that growth in emergency activity will continue to 
			rise above planned levels, putting pressure on the delivery of 
			elective targets&quot;.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">There is a series of other pressures. The 
			European working time directive has an impact on hospital junior 
			doctors' hours. Everyone understood that it was sensible to do 
			something about the hours that such doctors were forced to work, 
			which in some cases were ridiculous. It is good that junior doctors 
			are working more sensible hours, but has the cost of implementing 
			that reform been properly calculated? <br>
			<br>
			The costs of the new GP contract were supposed to be paid for out of 
			GPs taking somewhat less—on average, I think, £6,000 per GP. That 
			was to lead to the funding of the out-of-hours service, but there 
			are many reports from primary care trusts that the implementation of 
			the new GP contract has been underfunded or, in some cases, 
			unfunded. In addition, out-of-hours cover is patchy, with some very 
			good and some less good. A senior manager in the Norfolk health 
			economy told me that he thought that the main thing that had been 
			achieved in out-of-hours cover was the creation of confusion, so 
			that in some cases people simply did not know where to go because of 
			the profusion of options. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">In an e-mail that others might have seen this 
			morning, Waveney primary care trust talks about the 10 top tips for 
			staying healthy in winter. It lists different things that people can 
			do, including calling NHS Direct, looking things up on the internet 
			and Lord knows what else. However, many people think that, although 
			there is always a winter peak, the huge, aggressive increase in 
			emergency admissions throughout the country is directly related to, 
			among other things, the confusion surrounding out-of-hours cover and 
			the fact that many more people turn up at accident and emergency 
			departments than would have done otherwise. That is particularly 
			true when there is a shiny new flagship hospital that offers 24-hour 
			cover—a hospital that always has its lights on, is always open and 
			whose location people know. We have such a new hospital and despite 
			the fact that the Government managed to build it without building an 
			adequate road to get to it, it is still in some cases easier to 
			drive to than the old Norfolk and Norwich hospital in the centre of 
			town, simply because there is less traffic and one does not get 
			blocked in quite the same way. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">There is no doubt that emergency admissions 
			have increased, and that is partly because of the out-of-hours 
			arrangements. The Government have been experimenting with putting 
			GPs into accident and emergency departments. Sir Nigel Crisp spoke 
			about that recently and primary care trusts in Norfolk are talking 
			about funding a full GP practice at the hospital. That is an 
			interesting development and I look forward to seeing how it goes. 
			Finally there is recognition of the fact that, rather than tell 
			people what they should do and where they should go, we should 
			follow what people are doing, and enable them to be seen in a way 
			and at a time and a place that suits them, without the attendant 
			costs that would normally arise if they were actually treated by the 
			accident and emergency department. People arrive in the hospital, 
			but are treated by GPs at GP costs. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">There are many other cost pressures, such as 
			the increasing cost of specialist mental health treatments. That has 
			been made worse in Norfolk because it has been sending people out of 
			county, in some cases to London, at very high costs. There is also 
			the cost of the new consultant contract. Again, the Government may 
			have underestimated the cost of that and may well have been 
			out-negotiated by the consultants. In the face of rising 
			prescription bills the SHA has placed an emphasis on prescribing 
			more generic drugs and fewer branded drugs, but that has been done 
			for many years in the NHS. There is now quite a high rate of usage 
			of generic drugs, so I do not think that there are huge cost savings 
			to be gained from that. Let us also consider the costs of 
			the national framework for IT in the health service. The main 
			contracts let are worth £6.2 billion, but recently it was revealed 
			that the additional costs if all the implementation is taken into 
			account will be between three and five times more - in other words, 
			between £18&nbsp;billion and £30 billion over the next 10 years. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">All those costs added together mean that 
			primary care trusts have to run very hard just to stand still and to 
			have any serious opportunity of coping, even with the extra funding 
			that they have had. In Norfolk, we have the added problem of the 
			private finance initiative: it is an open question to what extent 
			that has increased overall costs. I am not dogmatic about the PFI. I 
			have examined a lot of PFI projects in many different areas and 
			there is no doubt that if one wants a hospital, prison or school 
			delivered on budget and on time, the PFI is a good way of getting 
			that. We have seen many examples of that across the country in 
			different sectors. It is also true that criticisms of the PFI 
			sometimes do not take adequate account of the potential costs and 
			the risks that would have attended on a different approach. 
			Conventional procurements are full of horror stories - take the 
			examples of the British Library, the Jubilee line extension and 
			Portcullis House, where the windows alone cost £23 million more than 
			they were supposed to and the wrong kind of bronze was used on the 
			roof, so it does not go bronze coloured. If I dare say so in the 
			presence of the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), there 
			is also the example of the Scottish Parliament, which is a locus classicus of how not to carry out a conventional procurement. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Let us be clear that the old way of carrying 
			out a procurement has had its problems. That is not to say that we 
			should not be questioning and critical about the PFI. It does 
			appear—and the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) has asked 
			many questions about this, as have I—that the way in which the 
			original contract for the hospital was let may have resulted in very 
			large windfall refinancing gains. So far as the contractors are 
			concerned, they will be shared on a 30 per cent.:70 per cent. basis 
			and will be crystallised immediately and yet as far as the hospital 
			is concerned they will have to be taken over the life of the 
			contract. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Most people do not think that their local 
			school or hospital ought to be put into an investment fund and 
			traded by City institutions; if there is enough income around to 
			make that possible, many people will question whether it would not 
			be better for the money to go to the school or to the hospital, many 
			of which have charitable activities going on alongside them because 
			they have not got enough money for some of the things that they 
			would like. A leading City investment banker who works in the 
			securitisation area of the PFI recently told me: </p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;I like PFI. It's a 
			good source of income. It's good for the business.&quot;</p>
			<p class="speechbody">But he added that, as a taxpayer, it really 
			cheeses him off, except he did not used the word &quot;cheeses&quot;. I feel 
			that in your august company, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should edit his 
			words. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">There are legitimate questions to be asked 
			about the PFI. I think that the answer lies in having the greatest 
			possible degree of transparency, so that we can form a fair 
			assessment of what the fair costs and the fair returns are. After 
			all, no one worries about schools or hospitals buying equipment from 
			the private sector, and in the PFI we are essentially talking about 
			buying services from private sector instead. We should not have an 
			ideological objection to the PFI, but we must examine it carefully.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody">The SHA has announced a number of measures 
			that it proposes to take to improve the financial situation. I will 
			not list all of those now, but details are available from the SHA. 
			There are certain questions that I think are legitimate to ask of 
			local health managers, particularly in relation to the learning 
			difficulties pooled fund. Notwithstanding the point made by the hon. 
			Member for Great Yarmouth, I emphasise that if we are to have joint 
			working arrangements, we need joint management arrangements adequate 
			to that task. Given the already considerable progress in prescribing 
			generic drugs in recent years, is it realistic to suppose that that 
			will provide serious savings in future? What can be done to reassure 
			people that the so-called &quot;better care for Norfolk&quot; proposals, which 
			aim to deliver cost-effective care closer to people's homes instead 
			of in much more expensive hospital settings, are about getting 
			closer to patients rather than saving costs? Are the out-of-hours 
			arrangements now in place working well and communicated well so that 
			people understand them when they are working well? </p>
			<p class="speechbody">I honestly do not think that there is 
			widespread bad management locally. Huge extra activity is being 
			imposed from the centre without the resources to pay for it. As I 
			said, 75 primary care trusts and 73 NHS trusts across the country 
			forecast deficits, which suggests to me that there is a systemic 
			problem. Norfolk's deficit accounts for about 6 per cent. of the 
			deficit of NHS organisations nationally - that is, in England - yet it 
			has only about 1.6 per cent. of England's population. It may be that 
			the Government are not only imposing costs on the NHS that are way 
			in excess of the resources that they make available, but, in 
			particular, that they have their sums wrong on Norfolk. There seems 
			to be problem of asymmetry: the country had managed a position of 
			financial balance until the rapid stream of reforms. Are we seeing 
			the systemic underfunding of Norfolk? </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Finally, I am interested in hearing the 
			Minister's comments on the extra costs that the Department estimates 
			will be imposed on Norfolk as a result of the national programme for 
			IT in the health service. GPs and others have expressed many 
			concerns that they may be forced to withdraw working systems that 
			they have developed incrementally over a long time—systems in which 
			they have faith and through which they have close relationships with 
			IT suppliers—and to replace them with systems whose software in some 
			cases has not yet even been written. Understandably, that is a cause 
			of huge concern among GPs, who, after all, are the people closest to 
			patients. If we are to see that kind of transformation with that 
			kind of uncertainty and at huge cost, it is not surprising that 
			people are concerned. I would be interested in the Minister's 
			comment on that IT issue. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">In conclusion, the Norfolk health economy 
			faces serious problems that are not the result of overall bad 
			management by local managers - notwithstanding the management issues 
			that have to be dealt with - but primarily the result of a high level 
			of extra activity and burdens imposed from the centre without the 
			resources to pay for them. </p>
