		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given as part of a debate on 
			Lifelong Learning in the House of Commons, on 11 December 2001</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk)</b>: I am 
		pleased to have the opportunity to introduce a debate on lifelong 
		learning, following the closure of individual learning accounts. The 
		subject is important to many people, including the students who were 
		able to use the scheme until the Government suddenly cancelled it. Many 
		of them were elderly, from ethnic minorities, unemployed or people who 
		had missed out in one way or another on the chance for an education and 
		who were seeking to do something about it. They suddenly found that the 
		courses that they had hoped to do were denied to them. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The subject is also important to the training 
		providers, who had done what the Government asked and set up 
		community-based schemes to deliver to people from all groups the 
		benefits of access to computer technology, only to find that the 
		Government suddenly closed down the ILA scheme. The subject is of equal 
		importance to all taxpayers, as there are indications that tens of 
		millions of pounds of public money may have been wasted and that there 
		may have been widespread fraud. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I shall quickly summarise the points that have led 
		to the present position. After two years of pilot programmes and 
		transitional arrangements, the Government introduced the individual 
		learning account scheme in September 2000. Under the scheme, the 
		Government offered £150 to help adults who were seeking training. The 
		Government awarded a £50 million contract to Capita plc to run the 
		scheme through the ILA agency. There were warnings even before the 
		scheme started that the scheme as proposed was flawed and would be 
		likely to lead to abuse. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">There were many such warnings, perhaps most 
		notably from Mr. James O'Brien of Pitman Training Group, one of the UK's 
		leading training providers, who wrote to the then Secretary of State for 
		Education and Employment on 20 September last year, before the scheme 
		was launched. In his letter Mr. O'Brien stated:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;We have expressed our 
		concern both to DfES officials and to Capita plc that there was 
		insufficient detail in the rules of the initiative. As a responsible 
		training provider we worried that this lack of detail left the scheme 
		open to abuse, which would not be helpful to either the initiative 
		itself or the majority of the training sector.&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">The Government then introduced a cap on the value 
		of the training at 80 per cent. of the first £250 of eligible training 
		in any one year, although that did not seem to do much to stop the 
		abuses that were going on. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">There were repeated stories in the press about 
		abuse of the scheme in the <i>News of the World</i>, <i>The Mirror</i> 
		and the regional press. None the less, the Government continued to 
		trumpet the scheme as a success. At the time, according to the 
		Government, there were signs neither of a huge fraud, nor of such a 
		massive increase in the take-up that the scheme required a rethink. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">On 20 July, the Under-Secretary of State for 
		Education and Skills, the hon. Member for Wentworth (John Healey), 
		issued a statement under the exciting headline &quot;Individual Learning 
		Accounts to continue into new era&quot;, which began:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Adult skills minister 
		John Healey today confirmed details of how the successful introduction 
		of Individual Learning Accounts over the last year will be followed up.&quot; </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I see the Minister smiling; I do not know how many 
		times he has heard that quote. It does not seem consistent with what 
		happened next. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Christopher Chope (Christchurch): </b>Does my hon. 
		Friend know that one of my constituents was summoned to a focus group 
		meeting at the Department on 25 July, and at that meeting told 
		Department officials what scams were occurring? Since then, nothing 
		seems to have been done about his specific complaints. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> I did not know about my hon. 
		Friend's constituent, although it does not surprise me that the 
		Government invited the constituent to a focus group meeting. We all know 
		the Government's great fondness for focus groups. It does not surprise 
		me that my hon. Friend's constituent explained to the Department that 
		scams were going on. As I mentioned, people were doing that even before 
		the launch of the scheme. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The scheme which the Minister described on 20 July 
		as leaping and bounding towards the future, and which was described by 
		the Secretary of State on 24 October as a &quot;great success&quot;, was to be 
		suspended from 7 December. The reason, she said, was that </p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;the rapid growth of 
			the programme has exceeded all expectations, causing us to think 
			again about how best to target public funds in this area and secure 
			value for money.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">The Secretary of State also mentioned her concerns </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;about the way some ILAs 
		have been promoted and sold.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">She stated: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;There is growing 
		evidence that some companies are abusing the scheme by offering low 
		value, poor quality learning.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. 
		Chope) may be reassured to learn that the notion that something was 
		amiss was starting to percolate, although the Secretary of State said no 
		more than that some people were abusing the scheme and offering low 
		value, poor quality learning. The possibility that they were offering no 
		learning at all, but removing the funds from the individual learning 
		accounts before the people whose accounts they were had the chance to 
		use them, was not mentioned. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Secretary of State continued by saying that in 
		order </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;to protect the 
		interests of individual learners&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">she had </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;decided to prevent any 
		further take-up of ILAs&quot;, </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">although learning begun by existing account 
		holders would continue to be supported, provided it was booked by 7 
		December. The Secretary of State assured learning providers and account 
		holders that </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;the decision to end the 
		programme has not been made lightly&quot;, </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">a fairly terminal sentence which caused many 
		training providers who had invested in the scheme a great deal of 
		concern. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The scheme was thus closed to new applicants. That 
		was an astonishing turn-about, considering what the Minister had been 
		saying only in July and compared with three months previously, when it 
		had seemed to be all systems go. However, the scheme did not close on 7 
		December, as the Secretary of State had announced. Suddenly, on 23 
		November, the Department put out an announcement that it had called in 
		the police to investigate fraud and theft involving individual learning 
		accounts, and that the ILA programme was to be suspended immediately, 
		two weeks earlier than had been announced. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">One of the key questions which remains unanswered, 
		to which I hope the Minister will provide an answer today, is what new 
		evidence emerged to justify the sudden change. If the fraud was on a 
		fairly small scale, as we had been led to believe, why did not the 
		Government deal with it and let the rest of the scheme go on intact? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I shall examine the effect of the sequence of 
		events that I described on the various groups involved: first, the 
		students whom the scheme was designed to benefit. I have a letter from a 
		constituent, Mrs. Marion Ford, of Harleston in South Norfolk. Mrs. Ford 
		applied for and was eventually sent a card with a membership number. On 
		receiving the card, she immediately went to a local computer training 
		firm in Harleston, only to be told via the ILA centre in Darlington that 
		there were no longer any funds in her account.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">As Mrs. Ford wrote to me, </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Apparently, someone had 
		registered me on Tuesday 13th November, but I only received my card on 
		Wednesday 14th November&quot;. </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Mrs. Ford had been registered by a different 
		computer firm for a course that she did not know about. Her letter 
		continued: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;How did they get my 
		name? How did they know I wanted to do a course? How many details of me 
		have they got, without my knowledge?&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">The case of Mr. Philip Geggie, which has been 
		brought to my attention, shows that even meeting the Government's new 
		deadline did not necessarily help. Mr. Geggie applied for an ILA account 
		before applications were shut down, but his ILA number took several 
		weeks to arrive. After the number finally arrived, Mr. Geggie applied 
		for and paid for his software on 19 November, four days before what 
		became the new deadline, 23 November, only to find that the ILA centre 
		was denying his training provider, Carrerra's, access to the Darlington 
		computer; so he could not be registered, although the Department had 
		said that it would honour only those who were registered. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In an e-mail to Mr. Nick Parry, an official in the 
		workplace learning division of the Department for Education and Skills, 
		Mr. Geggie wrote: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;What you should be 
		doing is to honour those people who are in the system and who have been 
		in the system from prior to 7th December and penalise those who are 
		abusing the system.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Parry replied:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;There has been some 
		comment that ILAs could have continued if we had taken action to remove 
		from the scheme those learning providers who were abusing it. You can be 
		assured that if there had been a reliable way of doing this immediately, 
		this action would have been taken.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That prompts the question of why the Department 
		did not listen to the advice that it was given in the first place about 
		ensuring that learning providers had approval first, before they 
		undertook training. We have a right to ask what will happen to the good 
		people who have done nothing wrong and who have been denied training, 
		simply because of the failure of the Government to promote a robust 
		scheme. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I had another letter from a Mr. Granville Powell, 
		a constituent of mine from Wortwell in south Norfolk. Mr. Powell signed 
		up for a course at the Suffolk Learning and Resources centre, just over 
		the county border in Bungay, Suffolk. He had already done two computer 
		courses and wanted to study for the European computer driving licence, 
		as he had decided that it would probably help him to get a job. On 
		receiving a letter telling him about the 7 December deadline, Mr. Powell 
		rushed to sign up quickly, only to be told that all funding had been 
		stopped anyway by the ILA centre in Darlington. He writes that he knew 
		about the alleged fraud from the newspapers. However, as he eloquently 
		puts it: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Why should the 
		excellent teaching people at the brilliant Bungay Resources Centre be 
		punished because not enough checks were put in place from the start?&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That brings me to the second group of people who 
		are affected by this fiasco: the training providers. Pitman Training 
		Group states in its document responding to the suspension of the ILA 
		scheme that it had expressed its concerns to Ministers and officials on 
		several occasions, since before the launch of the programme. It states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Without minimum 
		standards, anyone has been able to set up business as a 'training 
		provider' with the consequences that have become so apparent over the 
		past few months&quot;. </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">My own view is that it is just about 
		understandable that Ministers might seek to take a light-touch approach 
		to potential students. That is arguable. One could also argue that the 
		lack of any completion thresholds for students, and the tying of at 
		least part of the payment to the learning provider to such thresholds, 
		has made it much easier for unscrupulous operators to take the money 
		without showing any care whatever for the individual's learning 
		experience. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Indeed, Pitman Training Group advances precisely 
		that argument in its response document. Whether or not one agrees with 
		such a view, one can at least see that there is an argument to be put 
		for a light-touch regulation for customers, especially as they may lack 
		confidence because of negative experiences with more formal education or 
		training, or may wrongly feel that it is too late in life for them to 
		learn to use new technology. That is at least an argument to be 
		advanced, but I find it utterly incomprehensible that one would apply 
		such a light-touch regulation or criterion - perhaps the best description 
		would be a no-touch criterion - to the providers of the learning. Such an 
		approach has two very predictable effects, both of which are bad. First, 
		it guarantees that the quick-buck merchants, who have absolutely no 
		concern for the students and are interested only in taking the money, 
		will come steaming in for the kill. At best, students will get from such 
		people a pathetically inadequate course consisting of one booklet that 
		they could have bought for five or 10 quid anyway. At worst, their 
		individual learning account numbers may be stolen. Secondly, many good 
		training providers who are genuinely working to respond to Government 
		policy are tarred with the same brush as the bad ones, which is quite 
		wrong. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I shall mention some of the allegations that have 
		been flying around. I do not know whether they are true; it is for the 
		Minister to reassure us that they are not correct or to confirm the 
		situation if they are. It has been suggested that at least one training 
		provider was doing business of more than £1 million a week. Under the 
		new £200 scheme rules, a provider would have to find 5,000 students each 
		week - the equivalent of a small university - to generate such business. If 
		that has been happening, one wonders what the paymaster in the 
		Department was doing when he saw £200 going out of the door in one 
		direction, £20,000 in another direction and more than £1 million in a 
		third. Perhaps he did not know that that was happening, because it was 
		all done by computer and nobody did anything but press buttons until it 
		was too late. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Another allegation has been made by a banker who 
		spotted an account that was set up in July and into which more than £2 
		million had since been paid. Apparently, that money came purely from the 
		ILA scheme and there was no other source of income - not even the 20 per 
		cent. of funds that one would have expected from the student 
		contribution. It is alleged that, after the £2 million had dribbled in, 
		the account holder requested that the sum be transferred to an offshore 
		account. I have even heard it suggested that one dubious provider alone 
		may have been responsible for busting the Department's budget, in so far 
		as it appeared to have any budget or limit at all. Perhaps most horrible 
		of all, is it possible that some of these tricksters kept just within 
		the strict letter of the law, so that no action is possible against 
		them? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Training providers have told me that they were 
		approached by individuals attempting to buy large numbers of completed 
		application forms. I assume that that was against the law. God help the 
		Department if it managed to create a scheme in which even that was 
		permissible. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bill Wiggin (Leominster):</b> Jane Davidson 
		of the Welsh Assembly noted that the Assembly foresaw at an early stage 
		that ILAs would need to be closely managed to ensure that there was 
		minimal opportunity for fraud. How can it be that the Welsh Assembly saw 
		the potential for fraud, but the Department for Education and Skills did 
		not? </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> My hon. Friend makes an 
		extremely good point. It is extraordinary that the Welsh Assembly, 
		reputable training organisations such as Pitman Training Group, the 
		press and even the Office of the e-Envoy, whose annual report, published 
		a few days ago, refers to the need to look out for the potential for 
		computer fraud and to provide safeguards against it, could see the 
		problem and the need for safeguards, while the Department could not. 
		Everybody - the world and its brother - could see that need. Indeed, I 
		understand that the structuring of the scheme in Wales has been so 
		successful that there has been no abuse and that it runs to this day. It 
		is extraordinary that all the parties to which I have referred could 
		recognise the threat - and where possible, as in Wales, do something about 
		it - but that the Department could not. I share my hon. Friend's 
		astonishment at that. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I referred to the scam in which completed 
		application forms were being bought. It appears to have worked in the 
		following way. Scammers - if I may call them that - sought to buy for £40 
		each completed application forms bearing the name and address of the 
		student. When scammers succeeded in obtaining forms, they would copy the 
		names and addresses on to their own database.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">They would then send the forms to the ILA centre 
		at Darlington. Three days later, they would know that, all other things 
		being equal, the ILA centre computer would have generated an ILA account 
		number. They might then have hacked into the ILA computer - assuming that 
		there is no truth in the rumour that someone on the inside looked at the 
		computer because they were already inside the premises - and obtained the ILA number using the name and address. They would then have put the 
		number through one of the companies that they had set up. At that point, 
		the student would still be waiting for an ILA number to arrive in the 
		post, but the funds would already have gone. That would certainly 
		explain how the funds of my constituent, Mrs. Ford, were used up the day 
		before she even received her ILA account number. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">There have been so many examples in which funds 
		appear to have gone before clients received their account numbers - in 
		some cases, fake registration occurred as much as one month before - that 
		there appears to be something in the allegations. As I said, it has even 
		been suggested that there may have been corruption among individuals 
		inside the ILA centre, which is run by Capita. That is a most serious 
		charge that deserves to be examined at once, so that the position can be 
		made clear. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I look to the Minister to refute these allegations 
		or to tell us what has been going on if there is any truth in any of 
		them. The point is that the genuine trainers have had their good names 
		besmirched by a breed of rogue providers. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Paul Goodman (Wycombe):</b> On that point, 
		does my hon. Friend agree that bona fide operators such as my 
		constituent Stephen Good have been left in an impossible situation? 
		Inter alia, Mr. Good writes: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Should we, or should we 
		not, continue to retain our employees? If so for how long can we 
		continue to pay them when all payment due from DfES has been 
		indefinitely suspended and monies properly due for payment to us remain 
		overdue and unpaid?&quot; </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> My hon. Friend makes an 
		excellent point. I spoke to another training provider who asked 
		precisely the same question about whether he should hold on to his 
		employees. He was a computer manufacturer who had branched out into 
		training because he saw that it was a good fit in terms of his business. 
		His employees are relatively lucky, as there is at least a possibility 
		that he will be able to retain them. That is not the case with all the 
		providers. Even the business man to whom I referred said that he wanted 
		clarity above all. He wanted clear information about what would and 
		would not happen so that he could begin to make decisions. I am sure 
		that the same is true of my hon. Friend's constituent in Wycombe. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Genuine providers have been besmirched by rogue 
		traders. The real providers are varied and include big and small 
		businesses. Mr. Neil Avery, who is part of the Hairnet computer training 
		network, wrote to me from Taverham, near Norwich. Since January, he has 
		trained 33 people who have opened ILAs in the Norfolk area. His success 
		stories include a 21-year-old hospital cleaner from Norwich who wanted 
		to improve her employment prospects, a disabled elderly lady from 
		Norwich who can now keep in touch with her extended family through 
		e-mails and the internet, and, I am reliably informed, a Norfolk county 
		councillor who can better serve the community because she can now use 
		computer technology. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Internet Exchange was founded in 1994. It runs 
		38 stores throughout the country, from Glasgow to Southampton; from 
		Cardiff and Bristol to Cambridge, as well as in London, where the 
		company is concentrated. Many of the stores, especially in London, are 
		in deprived areas. Indeed, of the 34 stores in England, 25 are located 
		in wards that feature on the Department's list of the 2,000 most 
		deprived English wards. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Internet Exchange has invested in training and 
		worked with organisations such as the British Computer Society and the 
		Training Standards Council to ensure that its training is of the highest 
		quality. It has a diverse customer base: 51 per cent. female, 49 per 
		cent. male, 45 per cent. ethnic minorities, 15 per cent. lone parents, 
		and 35 per cent. unemployed or looking for work. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Hon. Members may hear more this afternoon about 
		Henley Community Online at a meeting in Portcullis house. It is a 
		not-for-profit company that offers computer and internet access. Two 
		hundred and twenty people currently participate in its courses. Like the 
		constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), the 
		people who run Henley Community Online are worried about what will 
		happen to them and their employees. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Carrerra's is part of the Digital Network group, 
		which is based in the west midlands. Between 40 and 50 per cent. of its 
		customers are either disabled, elderly or unable to train during the 
		day. It has taken on an extra 40 staff and invested in training them in 
		software at a new training centre, so that customers can have a high 
		quality training experience.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">All those people were doing the right thing; they 
		were doing what the Government asked of them. The Government owe them 
		tens, in some cases, hundreds, of thousands of pounds. What will happen to 
		them? Will they go to the wall because the Government did not have the 
		common sense to get rid of the rogue providers at the beginning? Must 
		they put their staff on the streets and thus add to the Government's 
		unemployment bill? Will they get the money that they are owed? Will a 
		new Government scheme emerge? If so, when? In a nutshell, what steps are 
		the Government planning to restore confidence in the training sector? We 
		look to the Minister for clear, specific answers. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Government have created an environment in 
		which the genuine training providers distrust them, and the most 
		vulnerable customers - those whom the Government are trying to help - are 
		scared off by stories of rogue providers. Mr. James Golfar of the 
		Internet Exchange wrote in his response to the closure of the ILA scheme 
		that the Department's explanation to clients of the scheme's operation 
		was poor. Many were unaware that the cards were issued by the 
		Department, not learning providers. They thus wrongly blamed the 
		learning providers for problems in their application process. Some, 
		especially those for whom barriers to learning were high, became 
		confused and disheartened as their applications were lost or rejected 
		unfairly, or when unscrupulous providers took advantage of them. Yet the 
		scheme was designed to help those people above all. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Minister and his colleagues should not 
		underestimate the good will and trust that have been destroyed by the 
		debacle. I hope that the Minister realises that the Government face a 
		crisis of confidence among legitimate, community-based training 
		providers and that warm words will not be enough. We need specific 
		proposals from the Minister about the steps that he plans to take. The 
		Government should be in no doubt that there is precious little hope of 
		helping the most vulnerable people if they do not restore confidence 
		among those who can do the most to help, namely, the legitimate training 
		providers. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I must mention the taxpayer's plight. I am 
		grateful to the Minister's office for supplying me with the figures 
		yesterday. However, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I 
		cannot say that they are pleasing. I have written to Sir John Bourn, the 
		Comptroller and Auditor General, and to the Chairman of the PAC, asking 
		for ILAs to be examined urgently. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">According to the figures that the Minister 
		supplied me with yesterday, the Department budgeted £202.1 million for 
		the ILA scheme over the two years 2000-01 and 2001-02. That includes the 
		Department's budget allocations and £115.1 million which has been 
		recycled from training and enterprise council resources. Department 
		records show that expenditure on the programme in 2000-01 and 2001-02 to 
		23 November totalled £260.9 million. That is an overspend of £58.8 
		million up to that point. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Minister said in his communication to me that 
		significant payments are due for claims that learning providers have 
		already made, and for committed expenditure for learning that providers 
		on the ILA centre system booked before it was shut down on 23 November. 
		He also stated that the police investigation into abuse and fraud means 
		that access to the ILA centre system is not available and it is 
		therefore not possible to estimate the additional financial commitment. 
		That is a scary remark. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Government know about an overspend of 
		approximately £60 million so far but do not know how much more is to 
		come. They have ignored the warnings of experienced professionals before 
		and since the scheme was launched. They have also ignored many warnings 
		in the press, and lost the trust of the genuine training providers 
		without whom they have no chance of achieving their goals. They have 
		been reckless with taxpayers' money and the people who suffer most are 
		ironically those whom the Government most want to help.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Government have a lot of answering to do. I 
		look forward to the Minister's reply.<br>
