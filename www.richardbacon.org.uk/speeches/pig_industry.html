  <h3>The British Pig Industry</h3>
  <hr size="1" id="line"><br>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Richard Bacon</span> <em>(South Norfolk) (Con): </em>It is a great  pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Bayley. I am delighted to have  secured this debate, as we have reached a critical juncture in the British pig  industry. I am also particularly pleased to see the Minister in his place, as I  know that he is a friend and ally of Britain's pig farmers and has taken a lot  of trouble to understand the problems faced by the industry.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">We should not underestimate the size of the industry.  The value of pork retail sales in the UK is about £8.7 billion, outpacing  chicken, beef or lamb. This is an important industry, but I am sorry to say  that it is in trouble. Just three weeks ago, pig farmers from our  constituencies and across the country flocked to Westminster to draw the  Government's attention to the plight of their industry. Many MPs will have  signed the 16-foot sausage in Whitehall and heard the rousing rendition of the  industry anthem &quot;Stand By Your Ham&quot;, all in support of the cry,  &quot;Pigs are still worth it&quot;.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I say &quot;still worth it&quot; because the Minister  and other colleagues with long memories may recall attending the 2008  &quot;Pigs are worth it&quot; rally. Like this month's rally, the 2008  gathering was a response to a sharp increase in feed costs that left the  industry on the brink of collapse. After the 2008 rally, led by the much-missed  standard-bearer of the &quot;Pigs are worth it&quot; campaign, Winnie the pig,  the industry returned to profit in 2009. That breathing space allowed farmers  to recoup some of their losses and take the opportunity to invest in  improvements to production and infrastructure.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Despite fluctuations in profit margins, the outlook  remained positive, at least for a few months, until last August, when the  industry was driven into crisis once more. The fleeting period of profitability  was not long or profitable enough for pig farmers to recoup the severe losses  that they sustained in 2007-08.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Greg Knight</span><em> (East Yorkshire) (Con):</em> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way, and I  congratulate him on securing the debate. Does he agree that one problem has  been our loose labelling law? Many consumers wanting to support the British pig  farmer by buying British pork have not always known when they were doing so,  because it is possible to package pork reared overseas as British if it is  merely processed here.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon:</span> My  right hon. Friend is correct. He might have seen my Food Labelling Regulations  (Amendment) Bill, which is scheduled for Second Reading on 1 April. Should the  Government wish to take this opportunity to announce that they will give it  Government time, I would be only too pleased to hand it over to officials to be  steered through the House. Yesterday, I was encouraged by a phone call from the  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs asking to see a copy. It is  important to say that there has been some improvement in labelling in the pork  sector, but I still believe and have always maintained that the only viable  long-term answer is a mandatory regime. We already have mandatory regimes for  many other foodstuffs; we should have one for pork and pork products as well.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The inexorable slide into loss-making as rising feed  prices have affected the industry has begun to cripple pig farmers in this  country once again. The price that pig farmers pay for feed has more than  doubled since 2010. Feed costs are rising faster than during the crisis of  2008, and I am afraid that the omens for the future are not good. BPEX-the  British Pig Executive, which is the industry body-estimates that feed, which is  generally made up of a combination of wheat, barley and soya, remains the  single largest cost for British pig producers and accounts for 77% of pig  farmers' costs, up from 60% in 2009. BPEX expects food costs to remain  historically high this year, and possibly beyond.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">That gloomy forecast is being borne out by recent  movements on the international cereals market. The Food and Agriculture  Organisation of the United Nations expects a tightening of the global cereal  supply this year, driven by growing demand after the slump in world cereal  production in 2010. According to the FAO, export prices of major grains have  risen at least 70% since February last year, and global cereal stocks are  expected to fall sharply due to a decline in supplies of wheat and coarse  grains. Market uncertainty after the Japanese earthquake caused prices to fall  from £214 a tonne in February to £170 a tonne last week, but as of last Friday,  wheat prices had climbed back to £195 a tonne. As one might imagine, recent  increases in the price of pig feed have had a severe impact on the cost of pig  production, which has risen to £1.64 a kilogram.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">However, although production costs continue to rise,  the dead-weight average pig price-the price farmers receive for the pigs they  produce-has fallen during the same period. In February, the DAPP stood at £1.35  a kilogram, 29p short of covering pig farmers' costs and 12p a kilogram below  the July 2010 price of £1.47 a kilogram.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Britain's pig farmers started 2010 in a state of  cautious optimism, their hope to rebuild based on the reasonably steady costs  that they faced and their improved returns in 2009, but by September 2010 the  industry had returned to making a loss, and by January 2011 the cost of  production had risen by one third compared with 2007. According to BPEX, a  farmer sending 200 pigs to slaughter in January this year stood to lose £4,500  in a single week. The pig industry is facing overall losses of £4 million a  week, and farmers are estimated to be losing more than £21 on every pig  produced.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">lthough the rising price of feed is undoubtedly a  major factor in the pain being suffered by British pig farmers, it is far from  being the only factor. The pressure on Britain's pig industry caused by rising  feed prices is being amplified by what can only be described as the decoupling  of the supply chain. For a supply chain to work properly, manufacturers,  processors and retailers must work collaboratively to bring down its costs  effectively and sustainably. However, it is clear that the pressure of high  feed costs is not being shared across the pigmeat supply chain. If anything,  the reverse is the case. Feed manufacturers have passed on the rise in the cost  of cereals to their customers-that is, pig farmers-but the costs of rising  prices have stopped with farmers and are not being passed up the supply chain  to producers and retailers.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The disconnect in the pigmeat supply chain can best be  illustrated by the relative performance of its constituent parts in the 12  weeks up to the end of January 2011. In that period, British pig farmers  suffered losses estimated at £35 million, which equates roughly to £416,000  every calendar day. However, over the same 12-week period, the processing  sector made an estimated profit of £100 million, or just over £1 million a day.  Retailers, including Britain's supermarkets, which set much store by their  support for British farmers, enjoyed combined profits of £192 million from pork  and pork product sales, equivalent to daily profits of £2.3 million.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Andrew George</span> <em>(St  Ives) (LD): </em>On the point about retailers, particularly supermarkets, the hon.  Gentleman well knows that we hope the Government will shortly introduce the  proposed supermarket adjudicator Bill. Although that cannot and should not be a  price-sensitive or price-setting mechanism, it will address the issue of fair  dealing. Does he agree that the sooner we pass such a Bill, the sooner we can  help not just pig farmers, but many other farmers and suppliers to  supermarkets?</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon: </span>I  agree. We all use supermarkets because in many ways they are efficient, but we  love to hate them because they are very powerful. We are not discussing perfect  competition. People sometimes speak of supermarkets as though they were  speaking of the market for foreign exchange, but this is an oligopolistic  arrangement. Supermarkets have large amounts of power that they do not always  use in the right way, and sometimes they misuse that power. I welcome the  Government's proposals for an adjudicator.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Keith Simpson</span>  <em>(Broadland) (Con):</em> I congratulate my hon. Friend and neighbour on introducing  the debate. If he will pardon the pun, this is like &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;  for other hon. Members and for me, as we have been debating the pig industry  for at least 10 years. Although I do not want to turn supermarkets into devils,  it seems to me that they stand condemned in two ways. The first relates to driving  down costs and forcing down farmers' profits, and the second is the labelling  itself. They are better now than they ever have been, but all too often, as my  right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr Knight) pointed out, they  put the Union flag on something and it is only when one reads the small print  that one realises that it is imported bacon or ham.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon: </span>My hon.  Friend is right. There have been some egregious examples involving some of the  best known and highly admired supermarkets. Marks &amp; Spencer, for example,  was guilty of such practices, but I think that there are fewer of them now. The  use of Union, English and Scottish-I was in Scotland for Christmas-flags in  supermarket aisles is better and more appropriate, but we are not there yet and  he is right that there is still work to do. Some supermarkets are leading the  way on doing what I think would be the right thing, both for themselves in the  long term and for the industry. I shall mention Morrisons in particular in a  moment.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">There is no doubt that supermarkets in general seem to  be using their part of the supply chain to insulate themselves against the  increasing costs of the production of pork and other pigmeat product, such as  bacon, ham and sausages.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Elizabeth Truss</span><em> (South West Norfolk) (Con):</em> Is it not a shame that we import 50% of all pig  products? Given that the Chancellor has just given a Budget for growth, would  it not be a good idea to try to become a net exporter of pork products,  particularly from Norfolk, which is where my constituency, as well as that of  my hon. Friend, lies? There does not seem to be a level playing field on  welfare internationally to enable us to increase our exports and decrease our  imports.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon: </span>My hon.  Friend is absolutely right-there is not a level playing field. BPEX has done a  lot of work on the issue and estimates that 70% of the pork imported to this  country is produced under animal welfare standards that would be illegal here.  In other words, 30% of what comes in meets our standards, and 70% does not.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Price promotions in supermarkets are a particular  problem. Tesco ran a price promotion in January in what are called the gondola  ends-the ends of the aisles-and it was very successful because of its high  visibility. Such promotions can increase sales by up to 200%. If a supermarket  has an uplift of 200%, not only will it want to keep the promotion going for  longer, but it will need more product. I fear that, at such times, even if  supermarkets such as Tesco are adhering, or say that they are adhering, to the  standards for their imports, suppliers will be under pressure and will get the  product from wherever they can, and the standards will not always be adhered  to.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">People may be familiar with the concept of stalls and  tethers, which are banned in this country. Tesco wrote to me this morning  pointing out that they will be banned in the European Union, but they will  not-an allowance will still be made for the use of stalls and tethers, although  the period will be restricted. Even so, that will not be introduced until 2013,  which means that if one visits a British farm and sees a stall and tether, one  will know that it is illegal, whereas if one visits a farm in other parts of  the EU, one will still be able to see stalls and tethers and will then have to  audit whether they are used for more than four weeks. I really do not know how  that can be successfully audited. There are still big issues to resolve.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I have no doubt that the behaviour of some supermarkets  has helped to suck in imports, which has had the effect of keeping the lion's  share of the profits at the customer-facing end of the supply chain, and of  ramming the rising production costs on to pig farmers.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Andrew George:</span> It  would be interesting to know whether the promotional campaign to which my hon.  Friend referred was effectively being funded by the suppliers themselves. I am  afraid that, too often, the so-called promotional campaigns of two for the  price of one are largely or mostly funded by the suppliers, not the retailers.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon:</span> Of  course, that is a common problem with very powerful retailers. We have seen it  in the book trade-many book publishers have been driven under by that sort of  practice by some book chains. We know that big factors in the marketplace mean  that it is constantly dynamic-no static position, even if it holds for a while,  will hold for ever-but that is another thing that the adjudicator needs to look  at, because it is an exercise of market power that distorts in a way that could  sometimes be thought of as anti-competitive.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Retailers have the power, if they choose to use it, to  make a difference by using their stocking, labelling and pricing policies to  promote the prominence of British produce and to ensure a fair return for  British farmers, including British pig farmers. I pay particular tribute to  Morrisons, which is the only one of the big four supermarkets to source 100% of  its fresh pork from Britain. Morrisons has also committed to using British-only  meat in its own-label sausages, and earlier this month the company's chairman,  Sir Ian Gibson-I am led to believe that he is no relation of the former Member  for Norwich North-wrote to me about Morrisons' backing for British farmers. He  said:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">
    <p class="newsbody">&quot;We  recognise the pressure pig producers are under and will continue to be strong  supporters of the sector. We are the only major supermarket to have such close  control over the provenance of its meat, buying pigs directly from Britain's  farmers and processing the pork ourselves&quot;.</p>  
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left" class="newsbody">He continued:</p>

  <blockquote class="newsbody">&quot;This  results in exceptional quality, freshness and value. It also enables us to  offer industry-leading support to British farming. Our commitment to source  100% British fresh pork is unique among the major supermarkets and in 2011 we  expect to reach the milestone of purchasing a million pigs a year from British  farmers&quot;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">That is extremely good news. Sir Ian added:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&quot;This  policy is popular with customers who we know show a preference for British  produce if the price is right. Our combination of British provenance and  quality at an affordable price sees us overtrade on pork-that is to say, our  share of the pork market exceeds our overall market share&quot;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I think there is a lesson there for other supermarkets.  Sir Ian continued by saying that not only are Morrisons</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&quot;major  customers of British farming but we consistently pay over the market price for  our pigs and we always have done. This was reflected in the results of an  independent satisfaction survey of our pork farmers last year, with over 70%  responding that they were happy at the price paid by Morrison&quot;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I salute Morrisons for backing British farmers so  wholeheartedly and I wish them every success in their million pig milestone</p>
  <p class="newsbody">It would be remiss to not also mention supermarkets  such as Waitrose, Marks and Spencer, Aldi, Lidl and the Co-op, which now all  source 100% of the fresh pork that they stock from British pig farmers. All of  that pork displays the red tractor mark, which is an independent logo that  guarantees that the food it adorns was sourced from farms and food companies  that meet Britain's high standards of food safety and hygiene, animal welfare  and environmental protection.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Such support, however, is not constant throughout the  retail industry. On the day before the &quot;Pigs Are Still Worth It&quot;  rally, Mr Andrew Opie, food director at the British Retail Consortium,  commented in a press statement entitled &quot;Pig farmers do have retailers'  support&quot;:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&quot;Retailers know some consumers prefer to buy  British. They're already doing what they need to to look after their supply  chain and secure a sustainable UK pig industry&quot;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I am afraid that that will raise a hollow laugh from  many pig farmers. Mr Opie goes on:</p>
  <blockquote>&quot;Supermarkets  do not generally pay farmers directly for their pork.&quot;</blockquote></p>
  <p class="newsbody">Well, that will be news to Sir Ian Gibson, because that  is exactly what Morrisons does. Mr Opie concludes by asserting that  supermarkets have no direct relationship with farmers. Unsurprisingly, the BPEX  chairman, Stewart Houston, described those comments as &quot;complete  rubbish&quot;, before adding that supermarkets</p>
  <blockquote>&quot;dictate  prices to processors who pass those prices directly to producers. It is a very  short supply chain and they have nowhere to hide. How much money there is in  the supply chain is determined by the price supermarkets pay. It is as simple  as that.&quot;</blockquote></p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Keith Simpson:</span>  Am I right in thinking that supermarkets or their agents frequently inspect  farms for hygiene, health and animal welfare?</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon: </span>They  certainly do. They inspect or employ auditors independently to inspect British  farms and say-Tesco has been saying this in correspondence with me over the  past few days-that they do the same in relation to their foreign supply chain.  I fear, however, that, when they have promotions at the discounted end of the  market, that audit trail may run out and the provenance will not always be as  clear as it should be.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Hon. Members may be disturbed to hear that there is  evidence to suggest that British pork products are quietly being withdrawn from  the shelves of our largest supermarkets and displaced by imports. Data from  Kantar Worldpanel shows that, over the past three years, the volume of pork on  sale in British supermarkets that does not clearly identify a specific country  of origin has increased, with a spike in sales of non-British pork having been  recorded recently, in the past few months of this year and late last year.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Families in my constituency and across Britain who make  their living from farming pigs may find their weekly shop at the local  supermarket increasingly dispiriting. In-store observation by BPEX suggests  that an overall increase in pork sales is being driven by promotional sales of  imported pork that does not carry a quality mark. Imported pork has replaced  British pork carrying either the quality standard or the red tractor. Where  major supermarkets have run promotions on pig products that are multi-buy packs  or are heavily discounted on price, it is mostly imported pork. According to  BPEX, just one in five pork loins promoted by Sainsbury's two weeks ago was  British, Asda's three for £10 promotion only included imported pork, and  anecdotal evidence from BPEX members suggests that Tesco's recent in-store  promotion on the so-called gondola end-end of aisle-of three pork products for  £10 also featured only Danish or Dutch meat.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">That is borne out by Pork Watch, the bi-monthly survey  of supermarkets conducted by representatives of the National Pig Association  and by Ladies in Pigs. The most recent survey found that the overall number of  pork facings-the shelf space allocated to a product line-has fallen from 80% in  November last year to 77% in February, which is the lowest figure for the past  12 months. Facings of the red tractor or the quality standard mark for  pork-both indicators that British welfare standards have been adhered to-have  also fallen slightly from 75% to 73%, after making small gains last year. It is  worth taking a particularly close look at Pork Watch's findings on Tesco: it  found that facings of &quot;British&quot; on Tesco pork had tumbled from 73% to  59% and red tractor facings had slumped from 63% to 55%-a fall of 14 percentage  points in the British category, which is the largest decline of facings of  &quot;British&quot; on pork in any British supermarket. About half of the pork  on Tesco's shelves does not bear the red tractor, which makes it unlikely that  imported pork meets the UK's welfare standards in all cases, despite Tesco's  claim that its overseas suppliers' standards &quot;broadly equate&quot; to red  tractor standards.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Let us be in no doubt that the situation facing British  pig farmers is extremely serious. Of course, neither retailers, individual  farmers, their industry bodies nor Members of Parliament can do much to  influence world commodity prices. Feed is expensive because cereals are  expensive, and that looks unlikely to change in the near future.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Simon Hart  </span><em>(Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire) (Con): </em>I hope that my hon. Friend can  help me on one point. Presumably, the story he is telling ends with pig farmers  leaving the industry. If that is the case, is the situation not serious for not  just pig farmers, but for agriculture and indeed rural Britain as a whole? I  suggest that problem goes much further than pig farming.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon: </span>It does  go much further than pig farming. People are beginning to exit the industry and  many are worried about whether they can expect to still be in the industry by  the end of this year. My point is that if we have a stronger pig farming and  farming sector, that is good for Britain, for the rural economy and for the  economy as a whole, and that that is good for the Tescos of this world and  their like. If the supermarkets took a longer-term view, rather than just  worrying about the next three months and the next quarterly results, it would  be better for them in the end. It is not an accident that Morrisons' fresh meat  sales have increased by 12% since it announced its 100% British pork policy. I  urge supermarkets that are not currently doing so to take a more pro-British  stance. It is incumbent on institutions-and such companies are institutions-of  the like, size and power of Tesco to do more than just think about one set of  shareholders; they have to think about the entire community of stakeholders, of  which they form such a powerful part.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Let me give an example. Tesco states on its website  that it supports British farmers, and hon. Members will have probably seen the  signs as they go into Tesco showing that it is the biggest customer of British  agriculture. On its website, it identifies 27 farmers whom it supports: five  produce apples and pears, five produce cheese, nine produce either beef or lamb  or a combination of the two, one produces watercress, one produces rapeseed oil  and one produces milk. There is not a single pig farmer among the 27.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr David Ruffley </span><em>(Bury St Edmunds) (Con): </em>Will my hon. Friend explain why the economics mean  that Morrisons can make a profit by sourcing 100% British pork when Tesco and  the other superstores he has mentioned cannot? What is the economic reason he  has divined for that?</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon:</span> My hon.  Friend makes a very interesting point because one might think that if everybody  could do it, they would. My point is they can do it and they should. The  economic case is that when customers see that supermarkets, such as Morrisons,  are backing British farmers and backing Britain, they are disproportionately  likely to go and shop in those shops and buy those products. They want to see  that the supermarket that they endorse by their shopping decisions-it is their  spending the money in their pocket that means a supermarket is profitable-is  also helping to back our community, back Britain and back British farmers. When  people see that, they respond. That has an economic effect of its own, which is  why Morrisons' policy has proved to be so successful. Other supermarkets should  follow suit.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The even broader point is that, even if the effects  were cost-neutral in the long term-I do not believe for one moment that they  are-the supermarkets should recognise that they are British supermarkets and  they are succeeding only because we have allowed the planning permissions to go  through, sometimes against people's better judgment, and enabled them to have  those locations. It is because we go into those supermarkets and spend our  money that they are able to make such profits. I come back to the question:  what kind of market are we talking about? We are not talking about the market  for foreign exchange; we are talking about enormously powerful players, and  with enormous power comes enormous responsibility. I am asking the supermarkets  to exercise that responsibility in a more measured way in the interests of this  country. I do not want to rant even more on that point, so I shall stop there.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">It is certainly true that some British supermarkets can  and do support British pig farmers, but only one of the big four sources 100%  of its pork in Britain. That is not good enough. In addition, the biggest of  the big four also seems to be slowly turning its back on British farmers,  offering cheap imports in the misguided belief-promoted by the British Retail  Consortium but disproved by Morrisons-that British shoppers do not care where  the meat comes from as long as the price is right. Retailers will no doubt  respond that they have to meet the variable demand of their customers and that  in the current economic climate price has to be a factor. However, I question  how much of the instability in the pigmeat supply chain is due to fluctuations  in customer demand on price and how much is caused by the internal operations  of the supply chain which, as I have set out, is entirely skewed in favour of  retailers.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">This is not simply a case of backing our heroic pig  farmers against the evil supermarkets because, as we have heard, some of our  supermarkets are trying to do the right thing. Of course it would be foolish to  state that shoppers will buy British whatever the price, but we also know that  it is possible to offer consumers British food at high standards of quality and  animal welfare all at an affordable price. Morrisons have shown that that is  possible and, if the producers can get a fair price for their pigs, we will  have the best of all possible worlds.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">When feed prices peaked in 2008, it took six months for  prices to fall back to a sustainable level, during which time many pig farmers  had left the industry. Today, three-quarters of the remaining farmers say that  they too will get out of the pig business if things do not improve within the  next 12 months. That would be a tragedy for not only pig farmers, but  processors, retailers and consumers. British consumers want to buy British  produce because they want to support British farmers and they believe that it  is the best. I have not wavered in my belief that a mandatory country of origin  labelling regime, combined with the widest possible support for the red tractor  and quality standard marks, will give shoppers the information they need.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The Minister acknowledged in the House last week that  the pig industry receives no subsidies. That is quite correct and I am  certainly not calling for that to change. However, if the Government value  having a British pig industry that sets the highest standards for quality and  animal welfare, they cannot simply shrug and believe themselves to be powerless  in the face of global food prices and grocery behemoths. The Government must  encourage the pigmeat supply chain to work as it should, so that pig farmers  can make a living, not a loss. Pigs were worth it in 2008. They are still worth  it today.</p>
