		<div class="asublist"><i>This speech was given in the Committee of the 
			Whole House on 27 April 2004 on Clause 4 of the Finance Bill, 
			concerning the proposed whisky strip stamp.</i></div>
		&nbsp;<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> 
			It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate 
			Hoey). I have had great affection for her ever since I stood against 
			her for Parliament. However, the combined efforts of many months of 
			putting out thousands of newspapers saying that I was zooming to 
			victory in the race for the Vauxhall constituency merely increased 
			her majority from 10,000 to about 18,000. Nevertheless, I remember 
			the contest with great affection.
			<p class="speechbody">I am glad that the hon. Member for 
			Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) is now back in his place, because I want to 
			congratulate him on what I can only describe as the magnificent 
			mental gymnastics in his speech. He said that he was dismayed by the 
			Government's decision to introduce tax stamps, and I should have 
			thought that the obvious corollary to being so dismayed would be to 
			vote against the Government on this issue. At times his gymnastics 
			were so magnificent that I lost his flow, so fast did he 
			pirouette, but I think I understood him to say that he would support 
			the Government tonight. </p>
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr. McFall: </b>Let me be 
clear. I spoke because I received a letter from the Scotch Whisky Association 
saying that this was a done deal in the Budget. It wants to reach the best 
outcome for the industry and it asked me, as the Member of Parliament for 
Dumbarton and as the chairman of the all-party whisky group, to help the 
association. I said that I would help it by negotiating with the Government. 
That was very clear and it is acceptable to me and to the association. I hope 
that it will be acceptable to everyone with whisky interests and who considers 
the industry as a whole and not in a partisan, narrow and bigoted way. 

<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> I commend to 
the hon. Gentleman an article by Daniel Finkelstein that appeared in The Times 
this morning. It said that when any politician begins a sentence with the words 
&quot;Let me be clear&quot; we should start worrying. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">I commend the hon. 
			Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) on his powerful speech. It seems 
			to me that four central points have emerged in the debate. The first 
			is that the scheme will impose very high costs on legitimate 
			players; the second is that it will be very damaging to small 
			businesses; the third is that it almost certainly will not work; and 
			the fourth is that it will encourage a whole new area of organised 
			crime. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The Government are 
			not new to fostering organised crime. The Roques report entitled 
			&quot;The Collection of Excise Duties in HM Customs and Excise&quot; came out 
			in July 2001, and Mr. John Roques studied the issue in great detail. 
			He pointed out that Customs and Excise had often encouraged the 
			scale of the fraud because, after identifying diversion fraud, it 
			let loads run rather than knocking them. Paragraph 7.5.3 on page 149 
			is headed &quot;Decisions to allow loads to run&quot; and it states: 
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;Of the seven cases where substantial investigations took place 
			before the knock,&quot; -</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			in other words, before the intervention occurred -&nbsp; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;it was typically the case that large amounts of revenue were lost 
			after the diversion of alcohol was identified.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			The report adds that</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;in one case I reviewed, it continued for over a year and in another 
			for over two years. This resulted in a large amount of revenue being 
			lost as a result of loads being allowed to run.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">I 
			know that things have improved since, and I am sure that that is 
			what the Economic Secretary will say when he winds up. He will be 
			right; things have improved since. However, we must remember that 
			background. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			The Government boast - the Economic Secretary did so in his opening 
			speech - that they are one of the few Governments, if not the only 
			one, to have made a reliable estimate of the amount of fraud that is 
			going on, so it is extraordinary that they have not estimated the 
			amount of fraud that is likely to occur from the introduction of tax 
			stamps. There is consistency in their approach. Perhaps we are being 
			a little unfair on them. The idea that one does not do a proper 
			estimate, that one does not carry out a thorough survey or 
			assessment and does not obtain a thorough understanding of the 
			issues - in the case of tax credits, they knew that something would 
			not work but they introduced it - has been common practice in 
			Government IT projects for many years. The policy is now being 
			extended to other areas. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) 
			mentioned the statement that the Chancellor made in April 2002, when 
			he appeared to be against tax stamps. Since then there have been 
			U-turns on everything from student tuition fees to the EU 
			referendum, so it is no surprise that there should be a U-turn on 
			this matter. I hope that the Economic Secretary will consider making 
			another U-turn, and I have a suggestion, which I will put to him 
			later, as to how he might accomplish that manoeuvre slightly more 
			elegantly. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			The hon. Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) made a very powerful 
			speech. I was shocked to hear that 50,000 tax strips can be 
			contained in something the size of a paperback book. If that is not 
			enough incentive for a whole new area of organised crime to develop, 
			I am not sure what is. I do not think that the Treasury has given 
			anything like enough thought to that. We have seen in the case of 
			SIM cards for mobile phones a whole new area of fraud, VAT carousel 
			fraud, for example, because the cards are so small, so portable and 
			so valuable. Exactly the same will happen with tax stamps; instead 
			of stamping out a problem, they are much more likely to make it 
			worse. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			Solving the problem of diversion fraud involves a simple issue: 
			having full traceability. As the hon. Member for Moray said in his 
			very good speech, there is full traceability now, in the sense that 
			one can identify the precise time at which a bottle of whisky was 
			created in the distillery and track it at every other point in the 
			process. If we can have full traceability for beef and other 
			products, we ought to be able to achieve it for whisky as well. The 
			answer is to head down that route rather than having tax stamps. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			The Economic Secretary mentioned the National Audit Office a number 
			of times; indeed, it is fair to say that he prayed it in aid. I do 
			not sit on the Scottish Affairs Committee, but I do sit on the 
			Public Accounts Committee, and when the Committee considered the 
			Customs and Excise standard report on 26 January, we were so 
			concerned about the disparities between the estimates from Customs 
			and those from the industry that we asked the NAO to do further 
			work. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			The Economic Secretary, who was quite fair in quoting the NAO 
			report, said that there are substantial uncertainties inherent in 
			any estimate of spirits fraud. He neglected to say, although I think 
			that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford may have 
			mentioned this, that there are differences between the two models 
			even when estimates are presented as a range of possibilities. 
			However, the NAO was careful to say in its conclusion that further 
			work was needed by the Office for National Statistics, by Customs 
			and Excise and by the industry, in the form of the Scotch Whisky 
			Association. That point was made briefly in an intervention by my 
			hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			There is a way forward for the Economic Secretary. I know that he is 
			a fair man, so I do not think that he could honestly say that he has 
			carried the House with him on this. The Government have quite a 
			reputation for rushing ahead with proposals that are not fully 
			thought out, although the Prime Minister has issued a memo saying 
			that that may be a bad idea. I suggest that rather than doing a 
			humiliating climb-down on this clause now, the Economic Secretary 
			should step back a little. Why, instead of doing a U-turn, does he 
			not do two L-turns? In responding to the debate he should say that 
			the House has clearly not been persuaded, that there are some 
			serious concerns and that we are about to spawn a whole new area of 
			organised crime, so we should work harder with the industry. As the 
			NAO said, further work is needed. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:0pt">
			In a few months, the hon. Gentleman should come back to the House, 
			having done all that work, and say, &quot;We have decided that tax stamps 
			are not the way forward,&quot; thereby completing the second L-turn. I 
			promise, at least on my own behalf, that if and when he does that, 
			Conservative Members will not crow; we will welcome it as a sensible 
			policy from a Government who, just once, have listened to the debate 
			rather than storming ahead with something that plainly will not 
			work.
