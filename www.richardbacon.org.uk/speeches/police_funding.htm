		<b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk):</b> I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak, and 
		add my congratulations to the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman 
		Lamb). I am grateful also because it is not often, after one takes part 
		in a debate and the Minister has wound up, that one has a chance to wind 
		up on the Minister's winding-up. In the debate on the police the other 
		day, she mentioned the question,&nbsp; referred to by my hon. Friend the 
		Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson), of extra burdens on the police. She 
		was worried about my description that
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">
		&quot;the need to introduce diversity in the police force and to deal with 
		child protection&quot; [<i>Official 
				Report</i>, 15 October 2003; Vol. 411, c. 219.] </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">were bureaucracy. I 
		was quoting from the chief constable of Norfolk's report to the police 
		authority, and I hope that she will accept that I was enumerating a list 
		of burdens. Whether good or bad, they are still burdens. I shall not 
		list them all again, but they are at column 208, and include everything 
		from best value - which is of questionable value, as my hon. Friend 
		said - —to things such as activity-based costing, the recommendations of 
		the Climbié report, and equal opportunities. I was making the point that 
		whether such things are good or bad, if the Home Office requires local 
		constabularies - including Norfolk - to do them, they impose extra time and 
		resource costs. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I also want to pick 
		up on my hon. Friend's point about helicopters, and the fact that we do 
		not have air cover. I have read a study published by the Public Accounts 
		Committee on the royal family's air and rail travel. By adopting a more 
		flexible approach, and by starting to lease and charter more, the royal 
		family succeeded in more or less doubling the miles that they flew while 
		cutting overall costs from about £17 million to £5 million. The 
		Government constantly remind us that they are accruing assets for the 
		future by paying for them over a period, such as the private finance 
		initiative building for the Home Office, never mind that for the 
		Treasury, so what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. 
		During our visit to the chief constable of Norfolk's top team, we were 
		told that the Home Office had said, &quot;We will give you a cheque now for 
		half the capital costs of the helicopter, but the rules do not allow you 
		to lease or charter&quot;. That seems insane. I hope that the Minister will 
		take that seriously. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I want to raise four 
		issues: first, the effect of under-policing in rural areas, such as 
		parts of my South Norfolk constituency; secondly, custody provision in 
		the central area, including the city of Norwich, the urban parts of 
		Broadland district and all of south Norfolk; thirdly, the special 
		constabulary; and fourthly, Government targets. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The central area is 
		central to the operation of Norfolk constabulary because it includes the 
		city of Norwich. As one officer told me, if central area is performing 
		well, Norfolk constabulary is performing well. The central area 
		comprises the urban parts of Broadland and all my constituency, which 
		includes some very rural areas, down to the Waveney valley and along the 
		south-east to the borders of Yarmouth, some of the most rural and 
		sparsely populated parts of Norfolk. Under-policing has an even more 
		dramatic effect in those rural areas. The majority of crime occurs in 
		the area around Norwich, so the biggest gains are made by deploying most 
		of the central area's resources in and around Norwich. As a result, 
		there is a constant battle in my constituency of South Norfolk to get 
		anything even approaching adequate cover. The police sector that is 
		managed from Diss, which excludes the north-west of my constituency 
		around Wymondham but includes almost all the rest, covers a population 
		of some 70,000 people and an area of about 270 square miles, but has 
		only two police vehicles and four officers. Greater London is just over 
		600 square miles, so the area is about half the size of Greater London. 
		To use an example closer to the Minister's home patch, the city of 
		Manchester - not Greater Manchester - is 45 square miles, so the area is six 
		times bigger than the city of Manchester. As I said, there are four 
		officers in two vehicles, and that is assuming that nothing happens. 
		That thin cover can be removed when there is the slightest problem. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The entire custody 
		provision for the central area is undertaken in Bethel street police 
		headquarters in Norwich. I visited those facilities to see the 
		conditions in the early hours of the morning, and I can vouch for the 
		fact that the quality and quantity are insufficient. On a busy night, it 
		is not uncommon for the Bethel street custody suite to be closed simply 
		because it is full, so that officers who apprehend people have to take 
		them elsewhere. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">A few months ago, a 
		police night crew arrested someone in Loddon in my constituency and had 
		to transport the individual to King's Lynn, which is in the constituency 
		of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham). 
		That is some 55 miles by road, so it is a three-hour return journey, 
		which more or less renders the crew inoperable for the rest of the 
		shift. If we add on the processing time once they get there, they are 
		not only inoperable, but out of area for the rest of the night. If there 
		is then just one extra incident in the city of Norwich that requires one 
		extra crew to be called in from South Norfolk, as sometimes happens, an 
		area half the size of Greater London has no police cover at all. My hon. 
		Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk was correct to say that this is 
		sometimes a matter of perception, but unfortunately it is also sometimes 
		a reality that very large swathes of rural England, covering many tens 
		of thousands of people, have no police cover for long periods. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">That brings me to my 
		third point, which is about specials. In Diss, there used to be 12 
		members of the special constabulary; there are now eight. Nationally, 
		the figures have fallen significantly—by several thousand. The 
		Government should look into that seriously, because apart from anything 
		else, providing specials is financially smart. It is also good 
		recruiting ground for the regular constabulary. It may be appropriate to 
		pay a bounty. I think that some forces are doing so. When I was in the 
		Territorial Army, a bounty was paid. It was not significant and I 
		certainly did not join the Territorial Army because of it. I joined 
		because I wanted to play my part in ending the cold war, and I am 
		pleased to say that within five years of my joining the Territorial 
		Army, the cold war had ended. I felt, therefore, that I could leave. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">My fourth point is 
		about Government targets. There are targets for burglaries, robberies 
		and vehicle crime, as has been said, but one officer said to me that 
		when he meets people in my constituency, in police forums and at parish 
		councils, he finds that for the most part those are not typically the 
		crimes that people worry about. He said that people worry mainly about 
		crimes such as graffiti, vandalism and the other low-level crime that we 
		hear so much about, and certainly people complain directly to me about 
		that sort of incident. The problem is that the targets lead the police 
		to take those issues rather less seriously, even though they know that 
		those are the main concerns of local residents. The incentive is to 
		prioritise other crimes, which people do not necessarily complain about 
		quite so much. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Those are the key 
		issues that I wanted to raise. I again congratulate the hon. Member for 
		North Norfolk on initiating this Adjournment debate, and I look forward 
		to the Minister's reply. <br>
