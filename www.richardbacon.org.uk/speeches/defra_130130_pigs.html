<div class="asublist"><i>This speech opened Richard's Adjournment Debate  in the Chamber of the House of Commons on 30 January 2013</i>. </div>
<br>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Richard  Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</strong> It is an enormous pleasure,  especially following our debate on Europe, to speak in an attempt to protect  the British pig, a noble beast, from the depredations of the European Union.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">On 1 January this year, a European directive, Council Directive  2008/120/EC, came into force throughout the EU. It lays down minimum standards  and requirements for the welfare of pigs, and, most notably, outlaws the use of  systems, known as stalls, which in fact confine sows in individual metal  stalls. It was originally passed in 2001, and in this respect—as in so many  areas of animal health and welfare—the United Kingdom has been in the vanguard.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The Minister is a former pig farmer, as is his predecessor, my right  hon. Friend the Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Sir James Paice), who is  also present this evening. I only wish that I too had been a pig farmer: I  should have liked that very much. My right hon. Friend and the Minister will  know—as, indeed, will many other Members—that Parliament placed a complete ban  on sow stalls in 1999, and that the United Kingdom had already achieved full  compliance with the directive when it came into force this year. Unfortunately,  however, that is not true of all member states.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">In June 2012, the European Commission reported that 18 of the 27 member  states expected to meet the January 2013 deadline for full compliance with the  directive. Despite assurances given to the Commission, however, figures leaked  from the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in December  2012 showed that 80% of member states were expected to fail to comply with the  ban.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Neil Parish  (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con):</strong> I welcome the debate, because  I want to draw attention to a difficulty affecting Europe’s enforcement of the  directive. One of the problems with EU legislation is that it is only when it  has actually become law that the European Commission can take action. It should  be able to take action before the event: that would enable the practice of  keeping pigs in stalls to be stopped in Denmark and in all member states.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In this country, once the rules  come into force on a given date—1 January 2013, in this instance—that should be  it. There is a huge difference between our approach to the law, what we do with  it and how we obey it, and the approach of many countries on the Continent,  where law and the making of law are more of an aspiration than a statement of  what is and how things should be. I do not want dwell on that point too much,  because it is outside the terms of the debate, but I think that it highlights  one of the fundamental differences between us and many European countries,  which makes the melding of our countries—should we wish it, which we do  not—almost impossible.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Jim Shannon  (Strangford) (DUP):</strong> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on bringing  this very important issue before the House. My constituency used to have 30 pig  producers, but we now have just one, although it is a large  one. The problem has been that we in the UK have religiously followed the  regulations, to the detriment of local pig farmers. Does the hon. Gentleman agree  that the supermarket chains should give a commitment to sourcing pork from  local farmers, rather than buying from across the rest of Europe?</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> Yes, that is important, and the evidence is that where  supermarkets—such as Waitrose and Morrisons —have made such a commitment, it  has had very favourable consequences and customers like it.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">As a result of 80% of EU member states not being expected to meet the  deadline, many illegal farms are likely to operate well into 2013. Only five  nations—the United Kingdom, Austria, Estonia, Luxembourg and Sweden—achieved  full compliance with the directive by the 1 January 2013 deadline.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">As the Minister will know, at the Council of Ministers meeting on Monday  of this week, fresh figures on the extent of compliance with the directive were  provided. The latest data from Agra Facts revealed that an additional five  member states—Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Romania—are now fully  compliant, taking the total number of compliant countries to 10. It is interesting  that some countries that might have faced more difficulties and that are less  economically developed have been able to achieve full compliance, while other  countries, such as France and Germany, have not. That speaks volumes about why  compliance has not been achieved. The reality is that it has not been achieved  because it was not in those countries’ interests to achieve compliance, as they  can get more profit by flouting the law, and they have done that up to, and  beyond, the last possible moment.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Many of these countries export to the UK in significant volumes,  including Denmark, the Netherlands and the EU’s largest pork producer, Germany.  To take Germany as an example, one quarter of the EU’s pigmeat—some 5.6 million  tonnes—is produced by German pig farmers. Recent Eurostat figures show that  Germany has 27.4 million pigs, over six times the number of pigs in the UK, and  18.5% of the overall EU pig herd. The website for German Meat, the joint export  promotion organisation of the German meat industry, proudly proclaims:</p>
  <p class="newsbody">“The production of pork has a long tradition in Germany. Production  methods and structures today are of a high standard and undergo constant  further development in terms of animal genetics, animal health, production  technology and hygiene.”</p>
  <p class="newsbody">However, the December 2012 figures for compliance show that fewer than  half of Germany’s pig farmers—just 48%—had achieved full compliance with the  directive. That figure now stands at 73%—so still more than a quarter are not  compliant—and both figures place Germany at 24th place out of 27 member states  in terms of the percentage of pig farms in full compliance.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">In December, four member states had compliance rates of below 50%:  Germany, Portugal, Belgium and France. Together, they produced 49.7 million  tonnes of pork and pigmeat. By contrast, the five countries that were fully  compliant by December 2012 produced 9.4 million tonnes. These figures help to  illustrate the scale of the challenge. Europe is awash with cheap pork produced  illegally, forcing down the price of pork and other pig products and adding yet  more pressure on Britain’s already hard-pressed pig farmers, who are complying  with the law, unlike many of their major competitors.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Sir James Paice (South East Cambridgeshire)  (Con):</strong> I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on raising this hugely important  issue for our pig industry. May I caution him about the use of the word  “compliance”, however? We are talking here about compliance with the EU  directive, but that directive does not meet the standards on our statute book  in this country. The EU directive allows farmers in other member states to  continue to keep sows in stalls for, I think, the first 21 days, while they are  being served —or mated—for the future. Therefore, every other farm in Europe is  entitled to have some sow stalls on their farm for that reason, but they are  completely banned in our country, so even European farmers who are in  compliance with the regulation are not necessarily keeping their pigs to the  high standards we uphold in this country.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend, who has probably forgotten  more about this subject than I will ever know, for pointing that out. In a way,  that makes my point even more strongly: even though the word “compliance” must  be treated with care, such farmers are not able to reach even that lower  standard, which shows how much further there is to go.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Of course, in this country we do have farrowing crates for sows that are  giving birth, which I support. That is the safest and best method. I have been  in pig houses and watched the process, and it is the right thing to do. The  British Pig Executive is sponsoring research into other methods, but at the  moment that is the best technology we have, and I support it.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The problem, however, is that, of the top 10 pigmeat-producing nations  in the EU in terms of production tonnage, only Romania and the UK are fully  compliant, and they are ninth and tenth respectively. The top eight countries,  by volume of meat produced, are non-compliant. They include Germany, with 6  million tonnes; Spain, with 3.5 million tonnes; France, with just under 2  million tonnes; and Poland, with 1.8 million tonnes. The vast majority of the  big producers are not compliant. In other words, the biggest pork producers are  those who have made the least effort to comply with the law and who have  benefited accordingly from lower costs. This is more than a question of  fairness or a matter of principle. Poor harvests last year have resulted in  very high feed costs. That is fine for wheat farmers, but for pig farmers, who  rely on buying feed, it is not fine at all, and means that many farmers are  under great financial pressure.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">If illegal farms either complied with the law, as they should, or  stopped producing pork altogether, that would tighten the supply chain and lift  pork prices, creating a much brighter future for those who have made  substantial investments in making sure the pork they produce is legal. It now  falls to the European Commission to work with member states to enforce the  protection of pigs directive. However, the Commission’s attempts to enforce it are  already going awry. An inadvertent and unofficial derogation has already been  granted to Ireland and France, after the European Commission gave them an  extension to the deadline for applying for funding for pig farmers who have yet  to convert their pig houses. Ireland has until September 2013 to access the  funds. In the case of France, a quarter of French pig farmers remain  non-compliant.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Together, Ireland and France account for 2.25 million tonnes, or just  over 10%, of EU pork production. Interestingly, that is more than the total  combined production of the 10 member states that are fully compliant, which  between them manage only 2.23 million tonnes, or 9.97%, of EU pork production.  Ideally, the money should be withheld until the French and Irish farmers  expecting these funds can prove that any illegal sow houses have been empty  since new year’s eve, although I recognise that in practice that would be very  difficult to achieve.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">However, there are three things the Government can do now that would  make a real difference to British pig farmers and help to stop illegal pigmeat  entering the UK. First, effective enforcement of the directive must begin at  home. The Government must ensure absolute clarity in their own buying standards  for pork and other pigmeat products. This affects purchasing for schools, the  NHS, the armed forces, local government canteens and every other public sector  body. By now, every tier of government, from Whitehall to the town hall, should  be making sure they are not buying meat that has been produced illegally, and  that they know they are not. The Government need to make sure that people in  the public sector are aware of this obligation.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">However, it is not enough for Government buyers simply to rely on  suppliers’ assurances of compliance. The Government must show leadership by  making certain that all their suppliers operate a traceable supply chain that  procures pork and pigmeat from legally compliant sources. The Minister will  recall that at the pig industry summit which I hosted in November, he undertook  to write to Government Departments reminding them of their obligations. I look  forward to receiving an update from him on this matter and hearing more about  what the Government are doing in this area.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Secondly, retailers and food service companies, having been shown  leadership by the Government in the way I suggest, should be strongly  encouraged to adopt full traceability, so that any pigmeat products they sell  are guaranteed to come from legal sources. Such companies should then be  expected to have fully transparent systems in place to guarantee that to their  customers. The need for full and open traceability has been aptly demonstrated  by the recent detection of horse DNA in beefburgers. That discovery not only  inspired the largest accumulation of equine puns known to mankind, but  illustrated the importance of a fully transparent supply chain.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Tesco chief executive, Philip Clarke, wrote the following in his  “Talking Shop” blog:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="newsbody">“We expect our suppliers to deliver to a standard, and to meet basic  food traceability rules. But our customers shop with Tesco, not our suppliers,  so you won’t find us hiding behind suppliers. It’s our job to ensure they are  meeting our high standards.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I commend Tesco for its speed in reassuring customers and withdrawing  suspect products from sale, but the key lesson to take from the scandal is that  food traceability rules need to be strengthened significantly. Retailers,  processors and food manufacturers know that improved traceability is difficult,  but they also know that it is possible. They need to be pressed for commitments  to guarantee traceability that extend to branded products such as Wall’s, as  much as to supermarkets’ own brands. Claiming either to have assurances from a  supplier or to have no control over branded products can no longer be regarded  as sufficient.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I am indebted to the National Pig Association for sharing with me an  encouraging letter from Mr Martyn Jones, corporate services director for the  supermarket Morrisons, to NPA chairman Richard  Longthorp. The letter stated that Morrisons’</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="newsbody">“commitment to the integrity and transparency of our offer remains  paramount. For the pork and pork products we are importing from the EU, we have  been clear to suppliers of both branded and tertiary products that this must  meet the requirements of the new pig welfare directive”.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I very much welcome Morrisons’ commitment to the transparency of the  supply chain. Every company within a supply chain should have sourcing policies  that can prove beyond doubt that the pork they are using or selling was legally  produced. I am sure that the Minister will join me in encouraging other  retailers to follow Morrisons’ example. I would welcome his comments on how  that might be achieved.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Finally, what must be avoided at all costs is a further protracted  period before 100% compliance across the EU is finally achieved. The European  Commission has a responsibility in that regard; it can and should be demanding  to see deliverable action plans from non-compliant countries. In the meantime,  we should stop illegal pork and pork products from entering the country.  Non-compliant nations must be pressed for specific guarantees on when they  intend to reach full compliance, rather than some vague promise to be delivered  by some indeterminate date. To encourage them, we should refuse to allow  illegally produced meat to enter the United Kingdom.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Member states have had more than a decade to move towards full  compliance with the directive, so there are no excuses. We used to have to say  that British farmers faced unfair competition from imported meat that was  produced overseas using methods that would be illegal in the UK. Now, British  pig farmers face unfair competition from imported meat produced overseas using  methods that are illegal overseas, too—we cannot accept that. We must bear in  mind what happened in the poultry industry. It had a far greater number of  regulations, agreements and testing regimes than the pig industry to help  enforce the directive on the welfare of laying hens. Nevertheless, a year on  from the original January 2012 deadline, an estimated 5% of Europe’s egg  production still comes from chickens in conventional battery cages.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The British pig industry receives no subsidies—pig farmers live and die  by the market—yet farmers across Europe who are in full compliance with their  obligations are being undercut by illegally produced pork and pigmeat. Above  all, what pig farmers across the UK want, and indeed what compliant pig farmers  across the continent want, is a level playing field. Those nations edging  towards full compliance have the largest number of pigs in the EU and they have  also had more than a decade to get their house in order.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Of course, I would ideally wish to see British pork as the first and  only choice for consumers, retailers, the Government and the whole public  sector. But right now what matters most is preventing British pig farmers from  being continually undercut by illegal pig products that should not be on the shelves  at all and should not be in this country at all. The UK’s pig farmers have had  to put up with an unfair market for 13 years, and that is far too long. The law  is now finally on their side, and I expect the Government to ensure that the  law is enforced.</p>
