<div class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Statement to the Planning Inquiry on wind turbines for Dickleburgh, Rushall and the Pulhams</div>
<p class="speech">This is the text of Richard's statement to the planning inquiry into the refusal of planning permission by South Norfolk Council into three wind turbines between Dickleburgh, Rushall, Pulham Market and Pulham St. Mary. </p>
<hr width="50%" align="center" size="1" color="#000000">
<p> </p>
<p class="newsbody">Many people here today will be aware that this Inquiry is  taking place against a backdrop of significant change in the planning system. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Coalition Government is acting to return power over  planning matters to Local Planning Authorities. &nbsp;The Coalition Agreement spells out this intent  in clear, unambiguous terms, stating that the Government:
<blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;&hellip;will rapidly abolish Regional Spatial Strategies and  return decision-making powers on housing and planning to local councils&hellip;&rdquo; <a class="dir" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[<span class="right">1</span>]</a> </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Ministers have repeatedly underlined the need for action to  address the serious democratic deficit in the way planning decisions are  currently being taken.&nbsp; During the Committee Stage of the Localism Bill  the Minister for Planning Policy, Greg Clark, told MPs that:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;&hellip; the problem with the present system is that there is not  enough incentive for people to accept development and there is not enough  community involvement, so it needs change. The system is broken and there is a  recognition that this is an historic opportunity to change it.&rdquo; <a class="dir" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">The Coalition Government wants to give local communities as  much discretion as possible over planning matters.&nbsp; Although the Localism  Bill, which is currently making its way through the House of Lords, contains no  specific provisions relating to onshore wind farms, the Government&rsquo;s reforms to  restore local control over planning will nevertheless apply equally to wind  farms being considered through the Town and Country Planning Act system.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Be in no doubt, this Government remains an enthusiastic  supporter of renewable energy.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the Minister for  Renewable Energy, Charles Hendry, told MPs that:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Common sense dictates that we should consider our own  natural resources. We have the strongest wind resource anywhere in Europe. To  turn away from that and say that we should not be using it would be a serious  mistake by Government, and one that we are not prepared to make.&rdquo; <a class="dir" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I agree.&nbsp; However, the minister added :</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Energy plants need to be sited in appropriate locations,  and common sense tells us that that is the right way forward.&rdquo; <a class="dir" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Again, I agree and this is the central point I wish to make  today.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">All the relevant planning policy guidance states clearly  that development, including renewable energy schemes,&nbsp; should only be  permitted where the impact that they will inevitably create is considered to be  acceptable.&nbsp; If the impacts of such schemes are not considered to be  acceptable then the guidance is clear: they should be refused.&nbsp;&nbsp; This  includes renewable energy schemes and applies to every tier of planning policy,  be it local, national or regional, at least until Regional Spatial Strategies  are finally abolished.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The appellant&rsquo;s proposed scheme  was judged to be contrary to South Norfolk local plan policies ENV1, UTL13 and  IMP9.&nbsp; These policies all state categorically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="newsbody">that  development will not be permitted where it would significantly harm&hellip;identified assets important to the character of the landscape<a class="dir" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>;</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li class="newsbody">that planning  permission will be granted for renewable energy projects provided that the  benefits of exploiting the renewable resource in the national interest are not  outweighed by demonstrable harm to the locality<a class="dir" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>;  and</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li class="newsbody">planning permission for new  development will only be granted where the Council is satisfied that the  development does not have a significantly adverse impact on nearby residents <a class="dir" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p class="newsbody">It is the contention of the appellant that the refusal of  planning permission on these grounds is not justified.&nbsp; However, it is my  contention that the refusal of planning permission by South Norfolk Council was  justified&nbsp; and entirely in accordance with local, regional and national  planning policies.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Throughout the relevant national Planning Policy Statements;  that is PPS1, the supplement to PPS1 on climate change, PPS7 and PPS22, it is  clearly established that planning authorities have a duty to protect and  preserve the environment, and that sources of renewable energy should <em>only</em> be exploited where the inevitable environmental and social impacts are  considered to be acceptable.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">PPS 1 states that planning should: </p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;&hellip;facilitate and promote sustainable and inclusive patterns  of urban and rural development by<em>&hellip;</em>protecting and enhancing the natural  and historic environment, the quality and character of the countryside, and  existing communities.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a class="dir" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a>&nbsp; </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">PPS1 continues:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Planning policies should seek to protect and enhance the  quality, character and amenity value of the countryside and urban areas as a  whole.&rdquo; <a class="dir" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">PPS7 underlines that the Government&rsquo;s objective is to  protect the countryside:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;&hellip;for the sake of its intrinsic character and beauty, the  diversity of its landscapes, heritage and wildlife, the wealth of its natural  resources and so it may be enjoyed by all.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" class="dir">[10]</a></blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Furthermore:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Many country towns and villages are of considerable  historic and architectural value, or make an important contribution to local  countryside character. Planning authorities should ensure that development  respects and, where possible, enhances these particular qualities.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" class="dir">[11]</a></blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">PPS7 also goes on to state that planning authorities should  provide for the &ldquo;sensitive exploitation of renewable energy sources&rdquo; <a class="dir" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> in accordance with PPS22.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">The climate change supplement to PPS1 calls on Local  Planning Authorities to:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Ensure any local approach to protecting landscape and  townscape is consistent with PPS22 and does not preclude the supply of any type  of renewable energy other than in the most exceptional circumstances.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="" class="dir">[13]</a>&nbsp; </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">This emphasis is reflected by South Norfolk Local Plan  Policy UTL13, which explicitly states that planning  permission <u>will</u> be granted for renewable energy projects, <u>as long as</u> the benefits of exploiting the renewable resource in the national interest are  not outweighed by demonstrable harm to the locality.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">This is consistent with PPS22, which states that renewable  energy developments should be capable of being accommodated throughout England  in locations where the technology is viable but, again, subject to the caveat  that: &ldquo; environmental, economic, and social impacts can be addressed  satisfactorily&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="" class="dir">[14]</a>.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">This caveat is best defined in the technical annex of the  companion guide to PPS22, which states that:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The material question is whether the proposal would have a  detrimental effect on the locality generally, and on amenities that ought, in  the public interest, to be protected&rdquo; <a class="dir" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a>.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">It was the unanimous judgement of South Norfolk Council that  the benefits of exploiting the renewable resource in the national interest were  outweighed by the demonstrable harm to the locality and to the residential  amenity of a number of properties, including in particular Semere Green Farm  and Barnacres and because these environmental and social impacts cannot be  satisfactorily addressed, the development is contrary to PPS22.&nbsp; The approach of Central Government is,  rightly, not to interfere with the jurisdiction of Local Planning Authorities  unless it is absolutely necessary to do so and it is widely understood,  therefore, that councils should be free to carry out their duties with the  minimum of interference.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">It is certainly the case that a substantial amount of  government policy supports the exploitation of Britain&rsquo;s sources of renewable  energy, including wind turbine schemes. &nbsp;One such example is the climate change  supplement to PPS 1, which states:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;An applicant for planning permission to develop a proposal  that will contribute to the delivery of the Key Planning Objectives set out in  this PPS should expect expeditious and sympathetic handling of the planning  application&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="" class="dir">[16]</a>. </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">However, &lsquo;sympathetic handling&rsquo; does not translate into the  automatic overriding of a Local Planning Authority&rsquo;s duty to protect the  landscape and the visual and residential amenity of its residents.&nbsp; If it  did, then renewable energy schemes would always be approved and planning  appeals would never take place.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">As has already been stated, the Government has signalled its  intent clearly and unambiguously to abolish Regional Spatial  Strategies.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;despite its impending abolition, it is important  to note that the East of England Plan also reinforces the principle that the  protection of the countryside from inappropriate development cannot be  automatically overridden by other considerations.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">According to the Plan, local planning authorities and other  agencies should: </p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;...seek to conserve and enhance the natural, historic and  built environment by positive management and protect it from development likely  to cause harm.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="" class="dir">[17]</a>&nbsp; </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Local Planning Authorities should also: </p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;protect, for their own sake, all important aspects of the  countryside, including individual features, special sites, their setting, and  the wider landscape&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="" class="dir">[18]</a></blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">And: </p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;conserve and enhance whenever possible regional and local  distinctiveness and variety, based on a thorough assessment of local character  and scrutiny of development impacts.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="" class="dir">[19]</a> </blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">In conclusion, even if one took little account of the  Government&rsquo;s clear intent on the future of the planning system, the existing  national, local and regional policy evidently makes development conditional  upon whether the proposal in question would have a detrimental effect on the  locality generally and on amenities that ought to be protected in the public  interest.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Furthermore, the direction of travel of the Government&rsquo;s  policy indicates clearly that the future of the planning system is in  empowering communities, through democratically elected councillors, to decide  for themselves how they should develop.&nbsp;  The damaging trend towards central control will be reversed and top-down  targets and requirements will go.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">This means that developers will be expected to provide  communities with a much clearer understanding of the <u>direct</u> benefits  they will receive from development and it will be for communities to decide for  themselves whether those benefits are worth the impact on their locality. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">South Norfolk Council held that the appeal scheme would have  a detrimental effect on the locality and that the public interest would best be  served by protecting local amenities from the proposed development.&nbsp;  Therefore, the decision of South Norfolk Council to reject this proposal was  taken with clear regard for, and in accordance with, all relevant Government  policies.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">It is therefore my view that that the appeal should be  dismissed.&nbsp; </p>
