</div>
		&nbsp;<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr. 
			Richard Bacon (South Norfolk):</b> 
			I beg to move,</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt; text-align:justify">	That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make further provision for 
			relevant information about food, including information about the 
			country of origin, contents and standards of production of that 
			food, to be made available to consumers by labelling, marking or in 
			other ways; and for connected purposes.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			I am 
			pleased to invite the House to give leave for the introduction of a 
			Bill to promote the clearer labelling of food. My proposal has 
			support from Members on both sides of the House, and the aim is 
			quite simple: to provide clearer, more accurate and more honest 
			information to consumers about the food they buy than is currently 
			required. </p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			There 
			are good reasons for seeking greater clarity in the labelling of our 
			food. The first relates to the standards of animal welfare. 
			Consumers make buying decisions according to various criteria, 
			including quality and value for money, and also according to 
			knowledge about the standards of animal welfare under which 
			livestock is reared. Consumers are rightly concerned to know that 
			the food that they buy in the shops is produced using the best 
			animal welfare practices. Farmers in the United Kingdom must observe 
			some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world, and that 
			has the wide support of consumers. Accordingly, consumers should be 
			able to use their buying decisions to support the production of food 
			that meets high animal welfare standards. However, British farmers 
			who adhere to those high standards often face unfair competition 
			from imported food that is produced to inferior standards and is 
			thus cheaper to produce. </p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			The 
			second reason for clearer labelling relates to animal disease. After 
			the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever, 
			animal health risks have taken on a new importance in the public 
			mind. The risks of animal disease in relation to imported food are 
			beyond the control of individual farmers, but there is a role for 
			the Government in ensuring that the provenance of all food is clear 
			to consumers through clear labelling. The commission set up by the 
			Government to review the future of farming under the chairmanship of 
			Sir Don Curry stated that the controls that are considered necessary 
			for food safety in this country should also be enforced on imported 
			food. In particular, it is for the Government to ensure that there 
			are the strictest controls, meeting the highest international 
			standards, on illegal meat imports. </p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
						The 
			third reason that we need clearer food labelling is that, at 
			present, consumers are being misled. For example, it is possible to 
			import lambs to the UK from France, slaughter them in the UK and 
			label the result &quot;Product of Britain&quot;. Pork that has been imported 
			from Denmark and then packaged in the UK may also be called &quot;Product 
			of Britain&quot;. Butter churned in England using milk imported from 
			Belgium should not, supposedly, be labelled &quot;English&quot;, but it can 
			lawfully be described as &quot;produced in England from milk&quot;. Norwegian 
			salmon that has been smoked in Scotland should not, supposedly, be 
			called &quot;Scottish&quot;, but it can lawfully be described as &quot;salmon 
			smoked in Scotland&quot;. At present, producers of imported meat can 
			lawfully use the Union flag on packaging to imply that the product 
			is British when it is not. In addition to the Union flag, phrases 
			such as &quot;Great British recipes&quot; may be used on the packaging 
						- for 
			example, on imported pork - again implying that the meat is British 
			when it is imported. </p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			The 
			fourth reason for clearer labelling is the position of British 
			farmers and farming. In recent years, the farming sector in this 
			country has seen the worst crisis for perhaps two generations. When 
			the Curry commission was first set up by the Government to examine 
			the future of farming, its remit included advising the Government on 
			how to ensure that the farming and food sector contributes to a 
			thriving and sustainable rural economy, as well as advancing 
			environmental, economic, health and animal welfare goals. One of the 
			key links in achieving those goals is the role of consumers, and in 
			its final report the commission stated:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align:justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;The key objective of public policy should be to reconnect our food 
			and farming industry: to reconnect farming with its market and the 
			rest of the food chain; to reconnect the food chain and the 
			countryside; and to reconnect consumers with what they eat and how 
			it is produced.&quot;</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			At the 
			heart of my Bill is the aim of empowering consumers. There is an 
			intimate relationship between the buying decisions of consumers on 
			the one hand and our continuing to have a farmed landscape that the 
			public can enjoy on the other. However, no consumer can make a 
			proactive decision to support domestic production without clear 
			information.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Garamond; color: black">
			Consumers may wish to exercise their choice in various ways. Their 
			choices might reflect the desire to purchase food that is produced 
			to our standards of production and animal welfare, or, by buying 
			local food, to reduce fossil fuel emissions by reducing the 
			long-distance transportation of food. Consumers may wish to buy 
			imported food from specific countries, or to avoid doing so. 
			Whatever consumers' desires, they cannot make informed choices 
			without accurate information at the point of sale, and that requires 
			clear food labelling. My Bill will require clear labelling of the 
			country of origin. If food has been processed or packaged in a 
			country other than the country of origin, details of the country of 
			origin will be marked on the label in no less prominent a manner 
			than the details of where the food has been processed or packaged. 
			Where animal welfare standards for the production of food are lower 
			than in this country, a reference to that fact should appear on the 
			label. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Garamond; color: black">
						I should 
			make it clear that my Bill contains no proposals to restrict the 
			legal import of foodstuffs, or in any other way to restrict 
			competition. Such measures would be likely to infringe international 
			trading agreements and European Union law. Under existing EU 
			arrangements, the labelling of the country of origin is already 
			required for fresh fruit and vegetables and, in the light of the BSE 
			crisis, for beef. Under EU law, the so-called &quot;promotion&quot; of food 
			from a particular country is not permitted, but the relevant EU 
			directive itself requires an indication of the place of origin of a 
			good if failure to give such an indication might mislead a purchaser 
			to a material degree about its true origin. The clear labelling of 
			the country of origin for all food, as my Bill proposes, offers 
			equal treatment to all producers. In fact, it is logically 
			impossible to suppose that providing greater transparency to 
			consumers in a given marketplace can be said to favour one product 
			over another. Providing more accurate information to potential 
			buyers and sellers simply improves the operation of that market. 
			None the less, if the happy consequence of greater transparency and 
			more accurate information is that more consumers choose to buy food 
			produced in Britain, I shall be very pleased, as will many farmers 
			and food producers in this country. That is not the same as 
			promotion, which is a matter for individuals and businesses. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Garamond; color: black">
						In that 
			respect, I pay special tribute to the Budgen's supermarket group. 
			While I was visiting the Budgen's store in Harleston in my 
			constituency, the chief executive, Mr. Martin Hyson, explained to me 
			the company's policy of stocking only British meat. I also pay 
			tribute to Waitrose, which has a policy of selling only British 
			beef, pork and chicken. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Garamond; color: black">
						Sadly, 
			not all supermarkets follow those excellent examples. Many 
			habitually use their near-monopoly power to screw down on suppliers 
			in a way that I believe is against the public interest. A food 
			manufacturer recently told me about another company he knows of, 
			which supplies major supermarkets in the UK. One division of that 
			company had a turnover of £400 million, yet made a profit of only 
			£150,000. In other words, for every £2,666 of turnover, the company 
			made a profit of £1 - a profit margin of just three-eightieths of 1 
			per cent. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Garamond; color: black">
						When it 
			is scarcely viable to be a food producer for the major supermarkets, 
			the temptation to cut corners grows, which may lead directly to food 
			scares and other problems. The ruthless behaviour of many 
			supermarkets forces suppliers to search out, at all costs, the 
			cheapest possible source of every ingredient, almost regardless of 
			the long-term consequences for animal welfare, the environment, food 
			safety, and the future of British farming. &nbsp;Restraining the 
			excessive power of the supermarkets is outside the scope of my Bill, 
			but I believe that providing consumers with the accurate information 
			that they need to make informed choices is a step in the right 
			direction. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Garamond; color: black">
			There 
			are some signs of progress. The National Pig Association promotes 
			the quality standard mark for British pork, which is useful to 
			consumers. The little red tractor mark, which the National Farmers 
			Union originally developed in conjunction with the Government, is 
			another useful measure, although it could do more. In fact, the mark 
			does not indicate definitively that food is British produced, but 
			shows only that the food complies with British standards. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Garamond; color: black">
			My Bill 
			would take matters a step further. I very much hope that British 
			consumers, armed with better information from clearer food labels, 
			will choose to support domestic production and thereby to support 
			higher animal welfare standards, British farmers and the sustaining 
			of a farmed landscape in this country. </span></p>
