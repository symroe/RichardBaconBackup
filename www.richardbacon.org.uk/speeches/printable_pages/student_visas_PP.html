<div class="bwp4">Student Visas and Higher Education</div>


	<p class="newsbody"><span class="asublist"><i>This speech was given as part of an Adjournment Debate on Student Visas and Higher Education on 8 February 2011</i></span> </p>
	<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Richard Bacon (South Norfolk)  (Con):</strong> I am  pleased to have this opportunity to debate the impact on higher education of  the proposed changes to tier 4 immigration rules, otherwise known as visas for  students. The importance of this issue was drawn to my attention by my  constituent, Professor Edward Acton, vice - chancellor of the University of  East Anglia, who is chairing the Universities UK taskforce on this issue and  who, like the Minister for Immigration, has recently given evidence to the  Select Committee on Home Affairs inquiry on the subject. I should remind the House  at the outset that the UK punches above its weight in this area: we have one in  100 of the world's population, but seven in the top 200 of the world's best  universities.</p>
	<p align="center" class="speechbody">Let me  start by making a couple of basic observations. First, some people will perhaps  be surprised - I certainly was - to learn that proper, genuine students are  seriously considered to be part of the migration figures at all. Certainly,  students must be subject to proper controls and have visas - student visas - but  since they are self - evidently a transient population who come to this country  to study, and who spend money in doing so, and who then leave when their  studies are over, it is not immediately obvious why they should be considered  as migrants. There is of course an issue - a very real issue - to do with  whether students actually leave and, more to the point, whether those who call  themselves students are nothing of the kind but in essence migrants by a  different name, playing the system to come to this country for the purposes of  long - term settlement. I will come to that later, but for now let me just say  that students who come from overseas to this country genuinely to study should  not in my view be properly understood as migrants, in the sense that they come  here to stay and settle, that by being in this country for a given period of  years they somehow acquire rights to stay that they did not have at the outset,  or that they are somehow the source of political anxiety about immigration - they  are not. They come here, they pay significant sums into our economy, they  study, they eat, they drink and then they leave.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">My second  observation is that I have noticed that some people talk about this issue as a  political problem. &ldquo;I know there is a political problem,&rdquo; they say,  and they mean by that that this Government came to office saying that they  would sort out immigration; they said that net immigration was too high and the  figures would have to be reduced; and that that was the political reality that  must be faced. The result is a clampdown - or potential clampdown - on visas.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">One hears  stories about eminent and hyper - qualified people, including some of the  world's foremost jurists and scientists, being unable to come to the UK to  work, although without having personal experience of each such story one never  knows for sure how true they are. I can say, however, that in my constituency I  have encountered a Japanese paper conservator qualified to postgraduate level  in both western and eastern conservation techniques who has had to leave the  country because of the new rules. On hearing such stories, people say,  &ldquo;That's not what we mean. We don't want to exclude those who are going to  help the country.&rdquo; I think of what my constituents say to me on the issue.  They have never said, &ldquo;Let's make sure we exclude the highly skilled - those  with something to offer and who are going to help the country.&rdquo;</p>
	<p class="speechbody">The  political problem in respect of immigration is quite different. My constituents  are sick to the back teeth of people cheating when they want to migrate to this  country - of people playing the system, and being more interested in what they  can get from this country, including our benefits and health service, than in  what they can contribute. My constituents hear stories about cheating, and they  believe that at least some of them are true and they want it stamped out. For  most fair - minded people, that is what lights the blue touch - paper in  respect of immigration. There is not any desire to keep out those who will help  us or those who want to study.</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Keith Vaz (Leicester East) (Lab):</strong> I congratulate the hon.  Gentleman both on securing the debate and on having sat through the entire  Select Committee sitting this morning. He will have heard every single witness,  including the Minister and the representative of Migrationwatch UK, say that  they have nothing against genuine students coming here, but that the people  they are against are bogus students at bogus colleges.</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I was particularly interested to  hear Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch UK, who I have always thought is a very  articulate spokesman on these matters, say that he was interested in bogus  students, bogus applicants, bogus colleges and genuine students who overstayed,  because those categories contribute to net migration, but that he would welcome  more genuine overseas students, as he thinks that is good for the country and  the economy.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">My fear  is that genuine overseas students have been caught up in all this, so let me  say how pleased I am that the Government have taken steps to deal with bogus  colleges. The Select Committee on Home Affairs produced a useful report on that  issue in 2009 and I gather from the Minister's evidence to the Committee today  that some 58 colleges have had their status revoked and the Government have  taken compliance action against a further 235, which may lead to suspension or  revocation of status. I applaud those excellent and worthwhile moves. Nobody  has a stronger interest in seeing bogus colleges put out of business than  legitimate providers. I should add that the Committee's previous recommendation  to restrict by law the use of the word &quot;college&quot; is a good one that  Ministers should take seriously.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">There is  no place for bogus colleges or bogus applicants; nor is there any place for  genuine applicants who overstay. We should have clear rules that everyone  understands and that are enforced. If we deal with the bogus colleges, the  cheats, the bogus applicants and those who fiddle the system, a great deal of  the heat - the political problem about immigration - goes away. At that point,  we face chiefly not a political problem, but a much more entrenched and  difficult economic problem. We are all living through the consequences of the  worst financial crash for a century or more. We know that this will be very  painful and that severe belt - tightening will take place, and we have seen the  Government make a start on that. We all know that any Government would have had  to do the same. We know that we have to rebalance the economy away from its  heavy dependence on financial services and have much healthier growth in other  sectors.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">We know  that in Norfolk as well as anywhere does in the UK, because Norfolk is poised  for significant growth in other areas of the economy, particularly once we get  the dualling of the A11 completed, which I am pleased the Government have  agreed. Norfolk is poised to help that rebalancing and not only through  tourism, agriculture and high value - added food production, in which East  Anglia has excelled, because there is a broader potential for growth. For  example, Norwich is home to a cluster of internationally renowned research  organisations in health and life sciences.</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Jim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP):</strong> Does the hon. Gentleman agree  that for a great many universities across the United Kingdom - particularly  Queen's university in Belfast - students on visas are very important to  research and development and to contact with companies? That potential needs to  be realised. Does he feel that the coalition Government can make changes to  ensure that the students who have the right to be in this country can make a  contribution to universities and, thus, secure development?</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I certainly hope so. I hope that  the Government understand, if they had not already, that two in five PhDs  undertaken in this country are undertaken by overseas students. Damage that and  we damage the research base of this country.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">More than  2,500 scientists are working at the John Innes centre near Norwich, the  Institute of Food Research, the Sainsbury Laboratory, the Genome Analysis  Centre and the university of East Anglia cluster, which together form the  Norwich research park. That is the largest concentration of food and plant  scientists in Europe. The IFR was recently ranked in the top two of 36,000  worldwide research organisations for the influence and citation of its  research.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">UEA also  has a growing medical school and a renowned school of environmental studies.  Other growing sectors include offshore and other renewable energy, including  tidal, biomass and biofuel energy production. In advanced engineering the area  has more than 1,000 engineering companies, employing a skilled work force of  about 10,000 people, which trade around the world with the likes of Boeing,  Airbus, NASA and Toyota. Group Lotus, which is based in my constituency, is  developing the next generation of high - performance cars using renewable  energies, as well as being the catalyst for a large cluster of advanced  automotive engineering businesses along the A11 corridor. Almost every Formula  1 team is supported by engineers based in Norfolk or is using engineering  invented in the county.</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr Robert Syms (Poole) (Con):</strong> My hon. Friend is making a  powerful argument. This is a very competitive area because there are other  countries, other language centres, and other colleges and universities to go  to. Unless we get rid of the uncertainty, we will lose millions of pounds and  thousands of students.</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> My hon. Friend is right because  the uncertainty is already proving damaging, particularly on the language  issue, as I will discuss in a second. In East Anglia, we see around us the huge  potential for a new rebalanced economy that places relatively less emphasis on  financial services and has growth in all these other sectors. We have the  potential for a golden triangle between Cambridge, Norwich and Ipswich, where  BT Martlesham has its own electrical generating capacity, because it uses more  electricity for computing power than many small towns.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">Where is  the role of the universities in all this? It is nothing short of crucial. As  the Minister knows, we need more skilled people - all Governments talk about  the need for more skills. Our education system produces far too many people who  are not equipped to go further, which was the subject of this afternoon's  Second Reading debate. Some people cannot study at university, because they do  not have the basics in English, maths and science. We have a shortage of  science and maths teachers, which is being made worse by a vicious circle: not enough  students reaching the basic standard; not enough students studying those  subjects at A-level; not enough good people therefore applying to university to  study those subjects; and accordingly not enough graduates to become teachers  to help solve the problem.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">What is  helping to break that vicious circle? The answer is overseas students. In many  STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - courses are  viable only due to the substantial proportion of enrolments from outside the UK  and the EU. If we get all this wrong, we will damage the possibility of our  economy recovering and rebalancing away from an over - dependence on financial  services. One need only look to the United States to see the enormously  important role of a vibrant university sector in driving economic growth.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">In 2009,  a study by the Kauffman Foundation on the impact of the Massachusetts Institute  of Technology, which analysed the economic effect of MIT alumni-founded  companies and their entrepreneurial ecosystem, concluded that if the active  companies founded by MIT graduates were to form an independent nation, their  revenues would make that nation at least the 17th largest economy in the world.  The state comptroller of New York has estimated that college and student  spending directly or indirectly provides nearly 500,000 jobs and generates more  than $62 billion of economic activity. The controller of public accounts in the  state of Texas has estimated that every dollar invested in the state's higher  education system eventually returns $5.50 to the Texas economy.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">Why are  those American comparisons interesting? The United States is the most  successful higher education market in the world. It is No. 1, but which is No.  2? Where is the second - favourite destination?</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Luciana Berger (Liverpool,  Wavertree) (Lab/Co - op):</strong> The university of Liverpool has 3,000 international students, who  generate not only &pound;30 million of income for the university but a positive,  knock - on effect for our local economy. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if  we do not ensure that those students can come to the UK, we will see, at a time  when we are seeing cuts to our university budgets, massive impacts on local  economies?</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> When funding is tricky,  universities are rightly looking for other sources of income - indeed, the  Government have told them to do so.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">As I was  saying, we are the second - biggest education market in the world.</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr David Lammy (Tottenham) (Lab):</strong> Will the hon. Gentleman give  way?</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I will not give way. I am sorry,  but I must make some progress, because I must leave time for the Minister to  answer and this is only a half - hour debate.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">The UK  higher education sector is a major export in a market that is set to grow  rapidly. Professor Steve Smith of Universities UK told the Select Committee on  Home Affairs that higher education is by some estimates the seventh largest  export sector in the UK - others have put it as high as the third largest - and  the market is growing by 7% a year. As the Home Secretary has pointed out, the  combination of international fee income and personal off - campus expenditure  by international higher education students alone already approaches &pound;5 billion.  That has become a vital income stream for universities and for the wider  economy.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">As I have  mentioned, Professor Edward Acton told the Home Affairs Committee:</p>
	<p class="speechquote">&ldquo;In  a tricky funding period, most universities plan to expand international numbers  in the immediate future. The ability to do so reflects and enhances the  performance and reputation of UK HE internationally: it is a Performance  Indicator in international league tables. Culturally, the international student  presence is key to ensuring our Home students prepare for and excel in a global  graduate market&rdquo;.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">The UK's  international alumni provide a healthy anglophile network among public and  private decision makers in every one of our trading partners. The key question  for universities is whether the Government intend to promote or restrict our  recruitment of bona fide non - EU students in higher education. As Professor  Acton stated in his submission to the Home Affairs Committee:</p>
	<p class="speechquote">&ldquo;The  answer might seem obvious, so forthright are No. 10, the Foreign Office and BIS  on the matter and so vast are the economic, financial and cultural benefits to  universities and the country.&rdquo;</p>
	<p class="speechbody">The  Foreign Secretary announced in January that</p>
	<p class="speechquote">&ldquo;as  British Ministers fan out across the world in the months to come we will be  promoting British education as well as our economy as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
	<p class="speechbody">On his  recent Asian trip, the Prime Minister emphasised</p>
	<p class="speechquote">&ldquo;how  much we want to welcome international students to Britain&rdquo;</p>
	<p class="speechbody">and that  international students are a</p>
	<p class="speechquote">&ldquo;great  way of forming a partnership between our countries&rdquo;.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">Professor  Acton and Universities UK fear that the UK Border Agency is set on a course  which, if it is not altered, will drastically reduce legitimate higher  education recruitment with a grave threat to pre-university pathway courses,  which produce an income for universities of &pound;1 billion a year. It is very  important at this point to distinguish, as Professor Acton does in his paper,  between sub-degree courses and pre-university pathway courses.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">The  Minister will know that the international passenger survey is deeply flawed and  that the Treasury Committee said three years ago that it was not fit for  purpose if that purpose was to play a central role in estimating international  migration. I urge him to continue engaging with the universities sector, which  has offered to pay for speedy research to provide the conclusive cross-check  suggested by Professor Acton in his paper. </p>
	<p class="speechbody">We cannot wait for several years  while e-Borders gets sorted - we need action sooner than that. The Select  Committee has explored these matters in depth and raised many interesting  issues, such as the role of accreditation bodies and whether they should be  merged, the place of post-work study and the requirement or otherwise to return  to one&rsquo;s home country. However, I shall not dwell on those issues because there  is precious little time left.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">I shall  concentrate on just two issues, the first of which is pre-university pathway  courses. Yesterday, I visited the highly impressive &pound;38 million INTO building  at the university of East Anglia, which provides pathway courses for 700  students each year, half of whom go on to study for degrees at the UEA and  about half of whom go on to university studies elsewhere. That aspect of  university provision is now a critical part of the international offer. Many  countries do not have the equivalent of a second-year A-level and their  students simply are not ready to start a university degree course without  further preparation. In providing such preparation, universities such as the  UEA are taking a sensible entrepreneurial to safeguard their future growth and  to help safeguard the UK&rsquo;s higher education market and make sure that it  prospers.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">The  second issue, which relates to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member  for Poole (Mr Syms), is the importance of the English language in the mix. At a  time when French universities have started offering university courses in the  English language because of the richness of the potential English-language  instruction market, I need hardly stress how important it is for the UK not to  damage inadvertently that market in the UK. I can speak personally for the  adage that there is no place to learn a language as good as the country  concerned. I was a student in Berlin, where I attended lectures in English and  German, and I acquired a new respect for any student studying overseas in a  language that is not their mother tongue. That is an extraordinarily difficult  thing to do without help. </p>
	<p class="speechbody">We are spoilt in the UK because English is the world&rsquo;s  language of business and academia. We are so used to hearing a high standard of  English among educated northern Europeans such as Swedes, Germans and Dutch - at  the B2 standard or higher - that we assume it is easily attainable, but it is  not. Those countries have invested a huge amount over many years to get to  where they are now. The B2 standard of English is not often achieved in  southern Europe and is seldom achieved in east Asia. Any measures that include  a requirement for a B2 standard of English as a condition of entry will have a  significant, damaging effect on the market for overseas students coming to the  UK.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">This goes  beyond language. The UEA has developed the innovative Newton programme in which  overseas students come to the UK to do A-levels in the sciences, mathematics  and economics in a university environment and have the opportunity to attend  lectures with university undergraduates in those disciplines. That is a great  way of marketing the university overseas and attracts some of the highest  calibre students. If there were ever an area that cried out for joined-up  government it is this.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">I really  want to hear from the Minister on one issue above any other: do the Government  intend to promote or reduce the UK's recruitment of bone fide non-EU students  in higher education? We have to get out of a big hole. It is simply critical,  at a time when the Government are asking universities to be more  entrepreneurial, to seek out new customers and to offer new courses that meet  the needs of those customers; and at a time when the whole economy needs a  lift, which the university sector can provide, that the right hand and the left  hand of our Government each know what the other is doing and that we do not  inadvertently choke off what should be a crucial part of this country's  recovery.</p>
	<p class="speechbody"><strong>The Minister for Immigration  (Damian Green):</strong> I  congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) on securing  the debate. I appreciate that the unusually large attendance for an Adjournment  debate means that many Members have come to intervene, but unfortunately, as my  hon. Friend has taken up two thirds of the time available, I am afraid I will  not be able to take any interventions. He has raised many important points that  I want to address in the brief time remaining.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">First,  let me put the consultation into perspective. Reforming the immigration system  and reducing the level of immigration to a sustainable number is one of the  Government's big tasks. The uncontrolled immigration levels of the previous  decade led to a loss of public confidence, strain on public services and an  increase in the visibility of extremist politicians holding unpleasant views  seeking to exploit the problem. We as a country need to reverse this, and we as  a Government are doing just that.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">We have  made it clear that we will take a different approach. We will tighten up our  system, stop abuse and support only the most beneficial immigrants. We set out  our approach last year to economic migration, we have just finished a  consultation on student migration, the specific subject of the debate, and we  will consult on families and settlement. We have indicated that, through a more  rigorous and controlled approach, we will see fewer non-EU migrants than in the  past. Our goal is an improved system that commands the confidence of the public  and serves our economic interests. We expect this to come through a system that  shows a significant fall in net migration to the UK, from the hundreds of  thousands annually that we have seen in recent years to tens of thousands over  the course of this Parliament. To set that in perspective, in 2009 net  migration was at nearly 200,000 and continued rising in the early part of 2010.  For non-EEA migrants - that is, excluding British and EU citizens - it was  around 184,000. My principal task is to reduce the numbers coming, increase the  numbers leaving when their visas are up, and eliminate abuse in the system, one  of the important points raised by my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">I am  taking action to tighten our migration system across all entry routes for non-EEA-migrants  - &nbsp;work, study and family - and to break  the link between temporary routes and permanent settlement. Some of the  measures will take effect in the short term. Others will set us on a long - term  road to sustainable immigration, where Britain benefits economically and  culturally from new skills and backgrounds, but in a context where people are  at ease with the changes that they see around them.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">On the  student immigration system, the majority of non-EU immigrants are students. Our  public consultation on the student visa system closed on 31 January and we are  carefully considering the more than 30,000 responses that we received, before  finalising our proposals.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">Let me  deal directly with some of the points made by my hon. Friend. The UK's education  system is world renowned. We remain the second most popular global destination  of choice for the many thousands of higher education students who choose to  study abroad each year. We want to encourage all those genuine students coming  here to study at our world-class academic institutions. Genuine international  students make an important financial contribution to the institutions that they  attend, including our universities, where their continued contribution will be  all the more important in the light of changes to the way in which those  institutions are funded.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">The  brightest and the best students who have the greatest contribution to make to  the UK will continue to be welcomed under the student route, but we remain  concerned that not all those using the student route at present are genuine  students whose main intention is to come to the UK to study. There are  significant numbers of students whose contribution is less easily defined.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">One of  the interesting points that my hon. Friend makes, which has also been made to  me by Professor Acton, on whose behalf he was speaking, is that we should stop  counting students as immigrants - that they come, they study and they go, so  they should not count. I am afraid to tell my hon. Friend that the definition  of an immigrant is a UN definition. It is not under my control or under the  control of the British Government. According to that definition, an immigrant  is somebody who comes to stay in a country with the intention of staying for  more than a year. That is the international definition.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">Those who  invite me to change the definition make a tempting case. I could at a stroke  define away 60% of the immigration into the UK. I could, with the statistical  stroke of a pen, define away the immigration problem, but I am programmed to  resist temptation. In all seriousness, the idea that any Government could say, &ldquo;We've  solved the serious problem of immigration simply by redefining what immigrants  are&rdquo; would have no credibility. It would clearly be an absurd thing to do. We  have to keep using the internationally agreed figures that are always used.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">It is  important to put the arguments in a proper statistical perspective. Students  now represent the largest proportion of non&ndash;EU net migration. In 2009 the  student route, including dependants, accounted for approximately 139,000 out of  the total net migration figure of 184,000, which is 76% of total net migration.  Recent Home Office research shows that 13% of those granted settlement in 2009  were originally admitted as students - 23,000 grants of settlement. Further  Home Office research shows that more than one fifth of those who came here as  students in 2004 were still here five years later in 2009.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">Another  point that is absolutely essential to understanding the debate is that all too  often there is an assumption that the vast majority of those students who come  here do so as university students. Actually, 41% of the students who come here  from abroad do so to study a course below degree level, and abuse is  particularly common at those lower levels. As my hon. Friend admitted, 58  education providers have had their sponsor licences revoked since 31 March  2009, and the vast majority of them were privately funded further education  colleges.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">Last  year, the post - study route, which my hon. Friend mentioned, allowed 38,000  foreign graduates to enter the UK labour market at a time when one in 10 UK  graduates were unemployed in their first six months after graduating. Another  common misconception is that because those highly skilled students are coming  to read degrees and then take up skilled jobs in the work force, surely they  are upskilling our general industrial output. In a survey of users of that  system in which respondents were asked about their current employment status,  of those in the tier 1 post - study work category - precisely those who are  meant to be the brightest and the best doing skilled jobs - almost one fifth  were unemployed and only half of those who were employed were in a skilled or  highly skilled job.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">It is too  sweeping a statement to say that the system as it has worked up to now is not  delivering highly skilled people into highly skilled jobs, because it is doing  some of that, but it is also doing an awful lot of something else that I  suspect Members on both sides of the House would not regard as desirable. As  was mentioned in the interesting Home Affairs Committee hearing this morning,  when the new system was introduced by the previous Government, there was such  widespread abuse in three parts of the world that after a few months the whole  system had to be suspended there: no student could be let in from parts of  China, India and Nepal because of the absolutely widespread abuse that we saw.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">I have  already identified the private sector FE colleges that provide education below  degree level as the area where we have the most worries. In the last year for  which we have figures, those institutions admitted 91,000 students, so we are  not talking about a small number of students on the periphery of a system that  basically involves universities. We are talking about tens of thousands of  students coming to institutions, the vast majority of which are not highly  trusted sponsors under our system. That is why one of the key proposals in our  consultation document is that only providers who are highly trusted sponsors  will be able to offer courses below degree level.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">Another  absolutely key item on which we have consulted is a stricter accreditation  system, which we need to create. The accreditation system that has grown up for  those private sector colleges in recent years is clearly not adequate, and we  are talking to those who regulate education, as well as looking at the way in  which we regulate immigration routes, so that a new accreditation system for  those institutions can be introduced which ensures our confidence in them. In  the past few days, we have finished the consultation, and we will finalise our  proposals over the coming weeks and, of course, announce our response to the  House as soon as possible.</p>
	<p class="speechbody">We want  to create for student migration a strong framework that requires education  providers to tighten and improve their selection and recruitment procedures. There  will be a greater emphasis on quality, and we shall drive abuse out of the  system. That will generate public confidence in the immigration system and  ultimately be good for all the legitimate international students who are  welcome to study here. Those changes to the student route are a vital building  block in our overall immigration policy.</p>
