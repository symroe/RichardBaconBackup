Better country-of-origin food labelling for British consumers 
<a name="top"></a><br>
&nbsp;<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
			<div class="asublist" style="text-align: justify"><cite>On 29 October 2008, I introduced a Bill into the House of Commons to change the law on food labelling. The aim is to give consumers more information about where the food they buy comes from</cite>
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
			<span style="color:black">Mr Speaker, I beg to move, </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">That leave be given to bring in a Bill 
			to make further provision for relevant information about food, 
			including information about the country of origin, contents and 
			standards of production of that food, to be made available to 
			consumers by labelling, marking or in other ways; and for connected 
			purposes.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">
			<span style="color:black">Mr Speaker, the first occasion on which I 
			sought the leave of the House to introduce a Bill to require clearer 
			labelling of food was in 2004.&nbsp; I was certainly not the first member 
			to seek to introduce such legislation, and many honourable members 
			across the House have supported the proposition that consumers 
			should have clearer, more accurate and more honest information about 
			the food they buy than is currently required. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">
			<span style="color:black">Since 2004, the interest in local sourcing 
			of food and local production has grown significantly. The issue of 
			&#8216;food miles&#8217; has become more prominent in political discussion. And 
			the importance for consumers of higher animal welfare standards has 
			continued to increase. Only this morning on the BBC Radio 4 
			programme Farming Today, an egg farmer spoke of his continued shift 
			towards free range hens for egg production, because this was what 
			consumers wanted.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">
			<span style="color:black">Attempts to improve the law continue and, 
			in addition to my own Bill, which has support from Members on all 
			sides of the House, I notice that the honourable member for 
			Warrington South will be seeking leave to bring in her own Food 
			Labelling Bill next week, which I understand focuses mainly on 
			nutrition and health issues. This complements my own Bill which, in 
			addition to providing information about the contents and production 
			standards of food, ensures that information about the country of 
			origin of different foods would be included on labelling.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">
			<span style="color:black">Consumers should have the information they 
			need to make informed decisions about the food they buy. There is a 
			wide range of issues which may quite rightly be of concern to them 
			in making their purchasing decisions. These include the nutritional 
			and calorific value of food, the salt or fat content, the animal 
			welfare standards under which food is produced, and the country of 
			origin.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">
			<span style="color:black">Any food labelling regime must seek to 
			address these various concerns.&nbsp; It is important that all food 
			producers adhere to the same high standards for food labelling and 
			the best way to achieve this is through a statutory framework.&nbsp;
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify">
			<span style="color:black">The Food Labelling Regulations 1996 
			require food to be marked or labelled with certain requirements such 
			as the name of the food, a list of ingredients, the amount of an 
			ingredient which is named or associated with the food, an 
			appropriate durability indication, any special storage conditions, 
			the name of business and manufacturer and in certain cases, the 
			place of origin, as well as the process used in manufacture and 
			instructions for use. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">
			<span style="color:black">In July this year the Food Standards 
			Agency has recently updated its guidance on </span>the use of 
			marketing terms such as 'fresh', 'pure' and 'natural' but there was 
			nothing new on country of origin labelling, although the
			<span style="color:black">guidance continues to draw attention to 
			Regulation 5 of the 1996 Food Labelling Regulations which requires:</span></p>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;&#8230;particulars 
			of the place of origin or provenance of the food if failure to give 
			such particulars might mislead a purchaser to a material degree as 
			to the true origin or provenance of the food&#8230;&#8221;</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span style="font-style:normal">Currently, 
			country of origin labelling must comply with the Food Safety Act 
			1990 and with the Trade Descriptions Act 1968.&nbsp; These make it an 
			offence to label any food in a way that falsely describes it or 
			which is likely to mislead as to its nature, substance or quality. 
			However, neither Act <span style="layout-grid-mode:line">defines how 
			much British involvement is required before produce can be sold as 
			British.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none">
			The specific expression &#8220;country of origin&#8221; is not defined in the 
			Food Labelling Regulations 1996 or in the Food Labelling Directive 
			2000/13/EC.&nbsp; However, the approach taken in Section 36 of the Trade 
			Descriptions Act 1968 is that, for the purposes of that Act, goods 
			are deemed to have been manufactured or produced in the country 
			where they last underwent a treatment or process resulting in a 
			substantial change. This is likely to include the manufacture of 
			bacon or ham, for example.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span style="color:black;font-style:normal">
			However, at present, consumers are being misled. Pork that has been 
			imported from Denmark and then packaged in the UK may be called 
			&#8220;Product of Britain&#8221;.&nbsp; The problem can apply to other food products 
			too.&nbsp; Butter churned in England using milk imported from Belgium 
			should not, supposedly, be labelled &#8220;English&#8221;, but it can lawfully 
			be described as &#8220;produced in England from milk&#8221;.&nbsp; Norwegian salmon 
			that has been smoked in Scotland should not, supposedly, be called 
			&#8220;Scottish&#8221; but it can lawfully be described as &#8220;salmon smoked in 
			Scotland&#8221;.&nbsp; </span>
			<span style="layout-grid-mode:line;font-style:normal">Slaughtering 
			in this country would count, so that &#8220;British lamb&#8221; could mean 
			imported lambs slaughtered and packaged in the UK. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span style="font-style:normal">Products can 
			be labelled as &#8220;produced in the UK&#8221; when all the ingredients come 
			from outside the country. There is concern that some companies have 
			taken advantage of these slack regulations and label their products 
			with the Union Jack, accompanied by slogans such as &#8220;traditional 
			British food&#8221;<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">&nbsp; or&nbsp; &#8220;great 
			British recipe&#8221; when in fact they are not produced in this country.
			</span></span></p>
			<p class="speechbody">There is obviously a duty on consumers to read 
			the labels in the first place but there is also a need to prevent 
			labels, presentation and other information being misleading about 
			the product. Country of origin is an element with a particular 
			potential for consumers to be misled.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Clear mandatory country of origin labelling 
			would significantly reduce the risk that consumers making a food 
			purchasing decision should be misled or in practice be unable to use 
			their consumer power to support domestic producers, if that is what 
			they wish to do.&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Country of origin labelling already exists for 
			beef and I believe it should be extended to cover other fresh meat. 
			There are more complex issues in the labelling of processed meat and 
			dairy products, where the sourcing frequently varies. I acknowledge 
			that these issues would need to be considered carefully in 
			Committee.&nbsp; Modern labelling technology has improved considerably in 
			recent years and I am persuaded that it would be easier for 
			processed food manufacturers to comply with country of origin 
			labelling requirements than in the past, but I acknowledge that 
			processed food does present greater difficulties for labelling than 
			fresh meat.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">This morning I was pleased to attend the David 
			Black Memorial Award Breakfast in the House of Lords, celebrating 
			the achievements of the British pig industry despite very difficult 
			conditions in recent years and, particularly, to honour the 
			contribution to the industry of this year&#8217;s award winner, Ian 
			Campbell MBE.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I was also pleased to receive a copy of this 
			film, <i>An Inconvenient Trough</i>, made by a group of pig farmers 
			and launched this morning. This is an excellent follow-up to the 
			campaign &#8220;Stand by Your Ham&#8221;, which last summer featured Winnie the 
			Pig in a stall opposite Downing Street, where she drew thousands of 
			visitors, including many honourable members. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">This film draws attention to the conditions 
			facing pig farmers, notably that 70 per cent of the imports of pork 
			and pork products into the United Kingdom are produced to animal 
			welfare standards that would unlawful in this country.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">It is in this context that we must look at 
			country of origin labelling. I must emphasise that this is not in 
			order to prevent consumers from buying products from where they 
			wish, but rather to ensure that they are making informed decisions 
			and that they cannot be misled.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Government can also do more. The pig industry 
			has produced its own Quality Standard Mark for Pork, and for other 
			pork products such as bacon and ham. This Mark shows that the meat 
			has been produced to higher animal welfare standards. Yet 76 per 
			cent of bacon served in Whitehall departments and 39 per cent of 
			pork served in Whitehall departments is only produced to the lower 
			EU standards, not to the higher standard of the Quality Standard 
			Mark.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">
			<span style="color:black">I make no secret of the fact that I wish 
			all consumers would buy British meat all the time. But achieving 
			this is a matter for consumers and it is not the purpose of my 
			Bill.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">
			<span style="color:black">I would just like to see a fair deal for 
			British farmers and to ensure they are given the chance to compete 
			fairly with overseas products; that the lower animal welfare 
			standards often applied to imported production are clearly marked 
			for consumers&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as the higher standards of domestic 
			production; and that farmers are able to engage the consumer in 
			supporting the high standards of food safety, animal welfare and 
			environmental care that lie at the heart of British farming and 
			cannot be undermined by misleading labelling of competing products. 
			A vital part of facilitating this shift in priorities would be to 
			ensure that this country has far more rigorous and transparent food 
			labelling. I commend this Bill to the House.</span></p>
