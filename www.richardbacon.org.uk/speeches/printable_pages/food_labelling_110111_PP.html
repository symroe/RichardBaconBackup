Country of origin food labelling<a name="top"></a>&nbsp;<p class="asublist" style="text-align: justify">
<cite>On 11 January  2011, I 
                introduced a Bill into the House of Commons to change the law on food 
                labelling. The aim is to give consumers more information about where the 
              food they buy comes from</cite></p>
			  <p class="newsbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) 
            (Con):</b> I beg to move,</p>
              <p class="newsbody">That leave be given to bring in a 
                Bill to amend the Food Labelling Regulations 1996 to provide 
                for information about the country of origin of food to be 
                made available to consumers; and for connected purposes.</p>
              <p class="newsbody">I  am pleased to invite the House once more to give leave for the introduction of  a Bill to promote the clearer labelling of food. The Bill is supported by  Members from all parts of the House and its aim is simple: to provide clearer,  more accurate and more honest information to consumers about the food that they  buy than is currently required. This is my fourth attempt to change the law on  food labelling, and I continue to campaign for compulsory country of origin  labelling, because I believe that the consensus on the need for a change in the  law continues to grow.</p>
              <p class="newsbody">Many  producers use ambiguous wording such as &ldquo;Produced in the UK&rdquo; and  slogans such as &ldquo;Great British Menu&rdquo;, &ldquo;British Classic&rdquo; or  &ldquo;The Nation's Favourite&rdquo; on packaging, often alongside the Union  flag, to imply that their product is British when it is not. When I last raised  this issue, I gave the House some of the most egregious examples of misleading  packaging, but I will not dwell on those today because there have been  developments since my last attempt to change the law.<br>
              </p>
              <p class="newsbody">Recently,  several organisations have issued guidance on best practice and codes of  conduct on food labelling. The pig meat supply chain task force, which counts  the Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whom  I am pleased to see in his place, as a member, recently announced a voluntary  code of practice for the labelling of pork and pork products. It calls for the  country of origin of the pork used in pork products to be clearly displayed.  That applies to the whole of the pigmeat supply chain. Those welcome standards  are hard-edged and meticulous, and take careful aim at ambiguous terms such as  &ldquo;Produced in the UK&rdquo;, which are still used.<br>
              </p>
              <p class="newsbody">Guidance  on origin labelling has been developed by the British Retail Consortium in  association with the British Meat Processors Association, the British  Hospitality Association, Dairy UK, the Food and Drink Federation and the  Business Services Association. The guidance, which aims to ensure that country  of origin information at the point of sale is consistent and clear, applies to  meat, processed meat products, milk, fresh cream, cheese and butter. It  suggests that using British flags, images, icons or landmarks, or any  suggestion of British or local origin through slogans such as &ldquo;British  Classic&rdquo; should be limited to products where the meat originates from the  UK. The code suggests that when a voluntary origin declaration is made on  composite products such as pies and casseroles, the country of origin of the  meat ingredient should be labelled if the meat is considered of primary  interest to the consumer or a predominant component of the product.</p>
              <p class="newsbody">Those  voluntary codes are steps in the right direction, but they are not the end of  the journey and there is more to be done. Significant concerns persist about  the effectiveness of voluntary agreements, and the  demand for mandatory country of origin labelling is growing. Helen Ferrier, the  chief science and regulatory affairs adviser for the National Farmers Union,  said of the British Retail Consortium's guidance:</p>
              <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Unless all companies sign up and then  consistently stick to their promises, some consumers will still be  misled.&rdquo;</blockquote>
              <p class="newsbody">Alice  Barnard, the chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, welcomed the guidance  and urged food organisations to sign up to its standards, but lamented:<br>
              </p>
              <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The code is not mandatory, which would offer  further protection still&rdquo;.</blockquote>
              <p class="newsbody">A  resolution calling for the mandatory clear labelling of food with its true  country of origin received unanimous support at the 2010 annual general meeting  of the National Federation of Women's Institutes. Its chair, Ruth Bond, said:</p>
              <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;We know that consumers want to make informed  choices and surely it is not right that consumers remain dependent on the  goodwill of retailers signing up to a voluntary scheme. Without legislation  there is no guarantee that consumers will get the choice and information they  are demanding&rdquo;.</blockquote>
              <p class="newsbody">Even  signatories to the British Retail Consortium's code recognise the importance of  mandatory labelling. Speaking on behalf of Dairy UK, Richard Hollingdale, the  sales and marketing director of First Milk, told the all-party group on cheese:</p>
              <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Although the current legislation requires origin  to be included on the pack, in practice consumers can be misled. Our view is  that consumer requirements for cheese can only be met by mandatory arrangements  that recognise the place of manufacture of the product.&rdquo;</blockquote>
              <p class="newsbody">The  director general of Dairy UK, Jim Begg, added:</p>
              <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;We're looking for a simple solution to resolve  this issue. You don't need a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But we do think that  a mandatory element is necessary to be effective.&rdquo;</blockquote>
              <p class="newsbody">Even  Brussels, which has often been cited as a roadblock to progress on country of  origin labelling, recognises the need for mandatory rules to be more widely  applied. On 16 June 2010 the European Parliament voted to accept draft food  labelling legislation that would expand the EU's requirements for country of  origin labelling on food to all meat, poultry, dairy products and other single-ingredient  foods. Then, on 7 December, EPSCO-the Employment, Social Policy, Health and  Consumer Affairs Council-reached a political agreement on draft regulation  16555/10, on food information for consumers. The proposed regulation states:</p>
              <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The impact assessment of the Commission confirms  that origin of meat appears to be the prime concern of consumers. There are  other meats widely consumed in the European Union, such as swine, sheep, goats  and poultry. It is therefore appropriate to impose the mandatory declaration of  origin for those products&rdquo;.</blockquote>
              <p class="newsbody">The  agreement also makes provision for the Commission to report, within three years  of the regulation coming into force, on the possible extension of compulsory  country of origin labelling to other foods, including milk; milk used as an  ingredient in dairy products; types of meat other than swine, sheep, goats and  poultry; meat used as an ingredient; unprocessed foods; single-ingredient  products; and ingredients that represent more than 50% of a food. </p>
              <p class="newsbody">The measure  will be considered by member states and then the European Parliament, and if  adopted it will take effect in three to five years, extending mandatory  information about the country of origin to the main types of meat on sale on  the British high street. It has the potential to extend to all meats, processed  meat products and dairy products.</p>
              <p class="newsbody">The  proposals have found support from consumer group Which?, which has stated:</p>
              <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;We support the EU proposals and welcome the new  voluntary scheme, but we want both to go further. Until food labelling is  mandatory, consumers won't get the full picture&rdquo;.</blockquote>
              <p class="newsbody">Mr  Meurig Raymond, deputy president of the National Farmers Union, has said:</p>
              <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;We believe there is no reason why mandatory  Country of Origin labelling should not be extended to the remaining sectors as  well as to the main ingredients of semi-processed foods.&rdquo;</blockquote>
              <p class="newsbody">British  farmers are keen for consumers to be well informed about where meat comes from.  Information for consumers is not protectionism. I am not in favour of  compulsion through legislation except where absolutely necessary, but in this  area it is necessary, and there is consumer support for a mandatory country of  origin food labelling scheme. We have been waiting years for a workable  voluntary scheme, and despite some welcome advances, we are still waiting. </p>
              <p class="speechbody"><span class="newsbody">It  is now necessary for the Government to accept that honest food labelling  requires the force of law, and that is what my Bill would provide. I commend it  to the House.</span></p>
