		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in the chamber of the 
			House of Commons on 22 October 2002</cite><p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk):</b> I join my hon. Friends and others in congratulating my 
		right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard) on 
		securing this important debate. I also congratulate her and her 
		colleagues on the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural 
		Affairs on visiting Easton college in my constituency to listen to local 
		people from Norfolk who are involved in the farming and food processing 
		industries. The information is still coming in, as my right hon. Friend 
		mentioned, and I shall refer to some of it, and especially to points 
		about the pig farming industry, which is enormously important to my 
		constituency. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I do not want to 
		dwell on biofuels or sugar beet, which were mentioned extensively by my 
		hon. Friends, but I endorse what they said. I hope that the Minister 
		will tell us what the Government plan to do because biofuels and sugar 
		beet are important to farmers throughout Norfolk. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">When considering the 
		regime for food imports to which my hon. Friend the Member for 
		North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) referred, few people have complete 
		confidence that food imports meet the stringent requirements that are 
		placed on our own producers. That applies especially to poultry and pig 
		farming, which are not subsidised by the taxpayer. People in those 
		sectors have no confidence that the Government have taken on board the 
		need to ensure that food imports meet our standards. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We must do more 
		about food labelling and labelling food with its country of origin. We 
		are currently discussing cigarette advertising and it is worth noting 
		that the size and shape of health warnings on cigarette packets are determined statutorily. There is no 
		reason why simple labels giving a food's country of origin that allow 
		the consumer to support the British farmer, if he or she wishes, should 
		not be determined in a similar way. The fact that there is no such 
		statutory labelling of a food's country of origin allows people to get 
		away with what most people would regard as tricks - importing food from 
		overseas, putting cellophane around it and calling it Norfolk sausages. 
		Neither we, nor our constituents, want that. I want the Government to 
		make progress. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I am not confident 
		that supermarkets are doing sufficient to promote British produce. 
		Although they occasionally have food campaigns for various countries,
		we are entitled to expect this country's 
		supermarkets to support British agriculture. If we want a farmed 
		landscape, as my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk 
		said, it is up to us all in the community and in business to support 
		that. The supermarkets do not do nearly enough. 
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">My hon. Friend the 
		Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) mentioned illegal imports. The 
		Government might have done something about that - I have been discussing 
		it with the Minister for nearly a year since we both served on the 
		Committee that considered the Animal Health Bill. It is 
		perceived that not enough is being done, although every report from the 
		Curry report to the report by Devon county council on foot and mouth has 
		mentioned the problem. I recently made two flights from abroad to United 
		Kingdom airports, and to use my hon. Friend's description, the 
		information campaign was certainly not in-your-face. We need more 
		action. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">My final point 
		relates to gold-plating regulations. At the meeting at Easton college, 
		Mr. Philip Richardson, a distinguished and well-known pig farmer from my 
		constituency, said that people in his industry had identified 20 areas 
		in which the Government were gold-plating pig industry regulations. One 
		example relates to the directive on the welfare of farm animals, which requires that sows 
		and gilts shall have permanent access to manipulative material. The 
		Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs version is: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;All pigs must have permanent access to a 
				sufficient quantity of material such as straw, hay, wood, 
				sawdust, mushroom compost, peat or a mixture of such, to enable 
				proper investigation and manipulation activities.&quot; </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Department 
		should have asked a vet whether it is sensible to have peat anywhere 
		near a pig. Peat is full of bugs, so are we seriously suggesting that 
		the Government will require farmers to sterilise their peat before they 
		make it available to their pigs? We can avoid such situations in 20 
		subject areas, and I will happily provide a full list to the Minister if 
		he wishes. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I did not think that 
		I would have time to mention planning, but it is worth stressing that 
		vacant farm buildings - a main asset for farmers - need close attention from 
		central Government if planning authorities are not to get in the way of 
		promoting our farming communities. <br>
