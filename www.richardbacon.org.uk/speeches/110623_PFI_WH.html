      <a name="ordayhd_34"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_ordayhd2"></a><a name="12042489000095"></a><strong>10.4 pm</strong><br>
      <a name="st_o463"></a><a name="12042489000028"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="12042489000103"></a><strong>Mr Richard Bacon (South  Norfolk) (Con):</strong> I am very grateful for the  opportunity to draw the attention of the House to the situation currently  facing Group Lotus, the largest employer in my South Norfolk constituency, and  the potential threat to 1,200 local jobs. I am very pleased to see parliamentary  colleagues here from Norfolk and I have received messages from my hon. Friends  the Members for North West Norfolk (Mr Bellingham) and for North Norfolk  (Norman Lamb), both of whom would have wanted be here in their capacity as  local Norfolk MPs, but who are both sadly overseas on Government business.<br>
      <a name="stpa_o378"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para38"></a><a name="12042489000029"></a>Group Lotus is a local and a national icon. It is a  famous sports car manufacturer with a very special heritage, and also an  important global engineering consultancy. The central concern is that following  the Malaysian Government’s recent sale of its stake in Proton Holdings—a  Malaysian company that is the owner of Group Lotus—to another Malaysian  company, DRB-HICOM, the new owner may respond to what are said to be a number  of Chinese businesses that would like to buy Lotus and relocate the  manufacturing to China.<br>
      <a name="stpa_o379"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para39"></a><a name="12042489000030"></a>The CEO, Dany Bahar, has stated publicly in a recent  interview that it would “make no sense” to move manufacturing. However, he also  stated the exact opposite at the Paris motor show in October 2010 and at the  Los Angeles motor show in November 2010, when it was stated that production  would shift abroad and that a new factory site would be decided on before  Christmas. One Chinese business, China Youngman, has had a commercial  relationship with Lotus for many years.&nbsp; The great fear in South Norfolk  is that there will be a repeat of the MG Rover saga when the remnants of a once  great British car company were picked up from the scrap heap and put on a boat  to China.<br>
      <a name="stpa_o380"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para40"></a><a name="12042489000031"></a>It is worth setting out why Lotus is so important and why  its continued presence in the UK is so important. The company was founded in  1952 by Colin Chapman, a legendary designer and inventor who, it is probably no  exaggeration to say, was an engineering genius. At the heart of Chapman’s philosophy  for automotive design was his famous maxim, “Simplify, then add lightness.” His  approach was driven by the belief that while adding power made a vehicle faster  on the straights, subtracting&nbsp; weight made it faster everywhere,&nbsp; and  so he focused on lightness and fine handling rather than on huge horsepower. To  this day, Lotus is well known across the world for its unparalleled  understanding of drive dynamics.<br>
      <a name="stpa_o381"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para41"></a><a name="12042489000032"></a>Lotus has made so many contributions to the history of  automotive engineering which are still influential—and in many cases in use  today in one form or another—that it is not possible to do justice to all of  them in this short debate, although they include the first ever use in a  Formula 1 car of a reclining driving position;&nbsp; a monocoque chassis design;  aerofoil wings; a wedge-shaped front; adjustable suspension; and many other  important innovations. This approach was rewarded with seven Formula 1  constructors championships and six drivers championships, and Lotus’s cars have  twice appeared in <br>
      <a name="column_924"></a><strong>24 Apr 2012 : Column 924</strong> <br>
    James Bond films, notably in “The Spy Who Loved Me”, when  a Lotus Esprit memorably transformed into a submarine.&nbsp;<br>
  <a name="st_o464"></a><a name="12042489000033"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="12042489000104"></a><strong>Jim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP):</strong> The hon. Gentleman says that there is a lot of Chinese  interest. I also understand there is interest from the Formula 1 Lotus team in  taking over the firm and protecting every one of those jobs. Does he agree that  its bid should be the one that is chosen?<br>
  <a name="st_o465"></a><a name="12042489000034"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="12042489000105"></a><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I certainly agree that it should be given the most  serious consideration. I understand that the owners of Lotus F1, which by the  way came second and third in the recent Bahrain grand prix, have expressed an  interest and said that they would see no reason to move any of the business  away from the UK. Their views should be treated with the greatest care and  consideration.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o382"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para42"></a><a name="12042489000035"></a>The production side of the business has been doing very  well and has built tens of thousands of relatively affordable and cutting-edge  sports cars, employing many local people in the process. The consulting side  has been so successful over the years that it is said that one in 10 cars in  Europe has something in it that derives from Lotus’s intellectual property.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o383"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para43"></a><a name="12042489000036"></a>Lotus moved in 1966 to Hethel in South Norfolk to a  purpose-built facility on the site of a former US air force airfield. The  business now employs around 1,400 worldwide, some 1,200 of whom work at the  Hethel headquarters.&nbsp; In 1996, Lotus was bought by Proton Holdings, a  Malaysian car manufacturer. Lotus has experienced financial difficulties at  times, but it was profitable as recently as 2008-09, when the Group Lotus  annual accounts show a profit before tax of £1.5 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It  is important to emphasise this point as one will find many incorrect references  in the automotive press to the “fact” that Group Lotus has never made a profit  since it was bought by Proton, when the actual facts are that the company has  been profitable quite recently. Lotus has a great story to tell and is at the  heart of an innovation cluster. The recent and growing success of the Hethel  engineering centre in nurturing a variety of high-tech small businesses has  been due, in large measure, to the pres ence of Lotus nearby. There are also  wider benefits along the A11 corridor that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid  Norfolk will address if he catches your eye, Mr Speaker.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o384"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para44"></a><a name="12042489000038"></a>If Lotus were removed, it would be a body blow to the  growing success of a local economy that is succeeding precisely as part of the  shift away from the overdependence on financial services that the Government  wish to see.<br>
  <a name="st_o466"></a><a name="12042489000039"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="12042489000106"></a><strong>Brandon Lewis (Great Yarmouth)  (Con):</strong> I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important  debate on a hugely important employer and an iconic name for Norfolk. Does he  agree that one reason we can highlight Lotus’s excellent forward thinking is  its recent fantastic work on alternative energies for vehicles that has led to  products such as the Tesla?<br>
  <a name="st_o467"></a><a name="12042489000040"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="12042489000107"></a><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I can confirm that. I will talk later about the Tesla,  which is a great example of the leading-edge technology that makes Lotus very  interesting to a wide variety of potential financiers.<br>
  <a name="column_925"></a><strong>24 Apr 2012 : Column 925</strong> <br>
  <a name="stpa_o385"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para45"></a><a name="12042489000041"></a>In common with many businesses since the beginning of the  worldwide financial crunch, things have been more difficult, but many observers  believe that Lotus continues to have a bright future and tremendous potential,  particularly given the company’s expertise in areas such as those that my hon.  Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis) mentioned, including  electric and hybrid vehicles. These skills make Lotus a very sought-after  partner for car companies across the world.<br>
  <a name="st_o468"></a><a name="12042489000042"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="12042489000108"></a><strong>Elizabeth Truss (South West  Norfolk) (Con):</strong> Does my hon. Friend agree that  engineering skills are vital for Norfolk and that the creation of the proposed  maths and science free school for 16 to 18-year-olds will be important to the  development of those skills and to Lotus and other engineering companies across  the county?<br>
  <a name="st_o469"></a><a name="12042489000043"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="12042489000109"></a><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I agree that the so-called STEM subjects—science,  technology, engineering and maths—are vital to firms such as Lotus, and I am  keen to see those developed through the proposal for a school specialising in  them.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o386"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para46"></a><a name="12042489000044"></a>It is important to note that although Lotus’s  contribution to the history of technology and innovation is already  imperishable, it has not stopped.&nbsp;In this Olympic year, it is worth  pointing out that Chris Boardman won the 4,000 metre pursuit gold medal at the  Barcelona Olympics riding a revolutionary lightweight and aerodynamic carbon  composite monocoque bicycle developed by Lotus.&nbsp;He also rode the Lotus  “superbike” to smash the world 5,000 metre pursuit record by more than 8  seconds.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o387"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para47"></a><a name="12042489000045"></a>Tesla Motors, which my hon. Friend the Member for Great  Yarmouth mentioned, is a business based in California whose investors included,  among others, the owners of Google. It asked Lotus to develop a fully electric  car, and the Tesla roadster was built in Norfolk and then exported to  California with extraordinary success.<br>
  <a name="st_o470"></a><a name="12042489000046"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="12042489000110"></a><strong>Simon Wright (Norwich South)  (LD):</strong> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this  debate on a subject that is so important for Norfolk’s economy. Whenever I have  visited Lotus, I have been impressed to learn about its advances in low-carbon  vehicle technologies. The UK car industry is a world leader in this area. Does  he agree that if Lotus were to leave Norfolk and the UK, it would risk losing  access to skills and expertise and jeopardising its ability further to develop  its reputation in low-carbon technologies?<br>
  <a name="st_o471"></a><a name="12042489000047"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="12042489000111"></a><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I have talked  about Lotus’s heritage, which is of stunning historical importance, but it is  the future we are concerned about. Lotus has demonstrated, with things such as  the Tesla project, the tremendous contribution it can make to the future and  its expertise in hybrid and electric vehicles.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o388"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para48"></a><a name="12042489000048"></a>Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer that has owned  Lotus since 1996 and invested considerably in it, was founded in the early  1980s under the stewardship of the then Malaysian Prime Minister, Tun Mahathir,  who, it is fair to say, is something of a visionary who has probably done more  than anyone else to create the Malaysia we know today—a modern country with a <br>
  <a name="column_926"></a><strong>24 Apr 2012 : Column 926</strong> <br>
    powerful economy and global connections. The Malaysian  Government held a large stake in Proton for many years, but made it clear that  they no longer wished to retain this stake. In early January, Tun Mahathir gave  his public blessing to the sale of the stake to DRB-HICOM, a major industrial  conglomerate with a wide variety of interests.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o389"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para49"></a><a name="12042489000049"></a>On 16 January, HICOM announced that it had bought the  Malaysian Government’s stake in Proton and thus become the ultimate owners of  Group Lotus. Incidentally, on the same date, Group Lotus announced the opening  of a major brand store in London’s Regent Street. Only three days earlier, on  13 January 2012, a UK-registered company, Lotus Youngman UK Automotive Company  Limited, company number 7909455, was incorporated at Companies House—that was  just three days before HICOM bought Proton—with the chief executive officer of  Group Lotus, Dany Bahar, as one of its directors. Curiously, that was not  announced to the Malaysian stock exchange until several months later, on  Thursday 12 April.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o390"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para50"></a><a name="12042489000050"></a>That is of particular concern because, as has been  reported in the newspapers, the CEO of Group Lotus, Dany Bahar, has a financial  incentive in his contract to sell the company, and because Group Lotus no  longer owns the right to use the name “Lotus” on cars sold in China. That right  is now owned by a small Taiwanese company, which licenses it to China Youngman,  a potential buyer of Group Lotus that is already importing Lotus cars into  China. That is an odd thing for any car company to do, particularly one whose  brand and the heritage are so important. The brand is a central part of the  company’s value, and it is hard to imagine selling it to others so that it  could not use its own brand name in a territory without let or hindrance, but  that appears to be what has happened.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o391"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para51"></a><a name="12042489000051"></a>By coincidence, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister  was in Malaysia recently, and he spoke to the head of Proton, Dato’ Sri Syed  Zainal. Unfortunately, it appears that only hours after our Prime Minister had  spoken to the head of Proton to emphasise the importance of British jobs at  Group Lotus, Dato’ Sri Syed was in China seeking a buyer for Group Lotus. That  has naturally caused immense worry and concern for the 1,200 employees at Group  Lotus.&nbsp;It is also unnecessary, because there are well-capitalised  potential buyers for Group Lotus with a credible plan to keep the business and  the jobs in the UK.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o392"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para52"></a><a name="12042489000052"></a>When I raised the issue with the our Prime Minister last  week at Question Time, he emphasised the importance of Lotus, saying that he  had raised the issue with the Malaysian Prime Minister and that the Government  were monitoring the situation closely. My fear is that, even if an agreement is  reached, any guarantees that might be provided about British jobs will later  turn out to be worthless.&nbsp;The Kraft Foods takeover of Cadbury comes to  mind in this respect.<br>
  <a name="stpa_o393"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para53"></a><a name="12042489000053"></a>One way of accomplishing a transfer to a Chinese owner  against the wishes of many of the interested parties would be to reach an agreement  in principle to sell Group Lotus but to present it as a joint venture rather  than a sale, then to wait until after the Malaysian elections—Lotus is rightly  valued by many in Malaysia as a jewel in Proton’s&nbsp; crown and the issue  could become politically divisive—and have a Chinese buyer such as China  Youngman acquire 100% of the business after 
  the Malaysian elections were safely out of the way,&nbsp;  transferring manufacturing to a new Chinese owner later. One could even have a  private side agreement to that effect.</p>
  <p align="left">People in Norfolk, most notably the loyal and  hard-working Lotus employees, want to ensure that that does not happen. I have  asked HICOM to consider carefully its responsibilities to local employees and I  hope that it will do so. However, I remain extremely concerned.&nbsp;The fact  that KPMG has been appointed with a mandate to sell Group Lotus to the Chinese  is not an encouraging sign. Nor is the fact that the Malaysian banks want their  money back from Proton. I fear that Proton will say that it has decided to keep  Lotus, while negotiating with the banks for as long as possible to write off or  reduce debt, then either hand what is left of Group Lotus to the Chinese or  liquidate it. The question for Proton in such circumstances would be:&nbsp;is  it planning to pay the suppliers? That is relevant because there are tens of  millions of pounds of accounts receivable outstanding, and many further jobs in  the supply chain beyond those at Group Lotus itself are affected.<br>
    <a name="st_o472"></a><a name="12042489000055"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew28"></a><a name="12042489000112"></a><strong>Mr Keith Simpson (Broadland)  (Con):</strong> Following my hon. Friend’s logic, what does he think our  Government can actually do, apart from using persuasion and nudging the people  who might be carrying out the actions about which he is rightly pessimistic?<br>
    <a name="st_o473"></a><a name="12042489000056"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="12042489000113"></a><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> The job of Her Majesty’s Government is to make it very  clear to the Malaysian Government and to the company that is the ultimate  owner—DRB-HICOM—that we take this matter very seriously, and that if it goes  the wrong way, there will be serious consequences for our relationship with  Malaysia.<br>
    <a name="stpa_o395"></a><a name="120424-0004.htm_para55"></a><a name="12042489000057"></a>To sum up the situation, the CEO of Proton Holdings—who  is now in any case only a temporary figure—was in China seeking a buyer for  Group Lotus only hours after our Prime Minister spoke to him in Malaysia  recently. A UK-registered company, Lotus Youngman, was set up in January 2012,  only three days before HICOM bought Proton, with Group Lotus CEO Dany Bahar as  a director, but this was not announced to the Malaysian stock exchange until a  fortnight ago. The CEO of Group Lotus is incentivised in his contract to sell  Group Lotus and has recently been in China. Any letter of comfort guaranteeing  jobs in Norfolk that might appear from a Chinese buyer is unlikely to be worth  much, if anything at all, especially given that KPMG has a mandate to sell the  business. However, there are well-capitalised would-be buyers of Group Lotus  who would definitely keep the business and the jobs in Norfolk, and 1,200 jobs  are at risk in my South Norfolk constituency if this goes the wrong way.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">I would urge the Minister and all his colleagues,  including the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister, to put all possible  pressure on the Malaysian Government to ensure that DRB-HICOM permits the sale  of Group Lotus only to a bidder who will provide credible guarantees for the  future of the business as an ongoing concern in Norfolk. I would like the  British Government to make very clear to the Malaysian Government, and to  DRB-HICOM, that they consider the issue of local jobs in Norfolk to be of  crucial importance and that a betrayal of the kind we have seen elsewhere in  the corporate sector is unacceptable and would have far-reaching consequences.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>George Freeman (Mid Norfolk)  (Con):</strong> I am grateful for this opportunity to speak. While Lotus  is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr  Bacon), it is only a mile over our shared boundary and many of the 1,200  employees and the affected families live in Mid Norfolk, particularly around  Wymondham. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member on securing this debate and  on setting out the arguments so clearly. I am keen to give the Minister as much  time as possible to address the important issues, so I shall make just three  simple points.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">First, the presence of Lotus and its legacy has led to  the creation in the area of a world-class cluster of engineering, manifested in  both the world-class factory and the expertise around it, and in the Hethel  engineering centre—a successful and now full incubator of successful start-up  businesses, feeding off and around the centre of excellence around Lotus. A  cluster of former Lotus employees, many of them successfully trading and  innovating, often from small premises around the area, provide an important  part of our local economy.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Secondly, the engineering cluster is central to the  Norfolk economy and, indeed, the wider East Anglian innovation economy and to  the wider rebalancing mission that I know is central to the mission of the  Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Thirdly, these engineering and manufacturing skills are  central to unlocking the full value of the wider innovation economy—in  particular, the science we have on the Norwich research park in the form of  biomedicine, agriculture and environmental science, and indeed, dare I say it,  down the A11, in the innovation corridor in Cambridge. We have huge  intellectual property skills in our area. In the past, we have sometimes been  weaker in the ability to turn that intellectual property into products that we  can sell. The skills in this cluster are central to developing and retaining  that value within our Anglian economy.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">I am sure I am speaking for other hon. Members across  East Anglia, some of whom are in their places and some of whom are not, in  urging the Minister to do all he can to ensure that the points raised by my  hon. Friend are given all possible attention, and to bring as much pressure to  bear as possible to keep this iconic and important business in the UK.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>The Minister of State, Department  for Business, Innovation and Skills (Mr Mark Prisk):</strong> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) on  securing this debate and on his energetic advocacy on behalf of his  constituents, not just today, but previously. He is right to say, as other  Members have pointed out, that Group Lotus is one of largest private sector  employers in the area, so I understand the importance that he and––as is plain  from the attendance this evening––the vast majority of Norfolk representatives  attach to the issue. They want to ensure that we as a Chamber understand how  importantly their constituents view this matter.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Today’s debate follows on from parliamentary questions  from my hon. Friend, from correspondence and, indeed, from considerable speculation  in the media. I know that he will appreciate that I cannot comment on media 
    speculation, but as I made clear to him last night, when  we had an opportunity to discuss the issue—with him having raised it and me  wanting to ensure that I understood the detail of his concerns—he should  understand that the whole of the Government take this matter extremely  seriously, and we are already actively engaged in it.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Let me respond to the sensible points, if I may say so,  about the calibre of the company that we are dealing with. Lotus is a  world-class design engineering company, and, as we have heard, a manufacturer  of highly desirable sports cars, supported of course by a dedicated and experienced  work force. The group, which has more than 60 years of history behind it,  comprises Lotus Cars, Lotus Engineering and Lotus Racing. As my hon. Friend  observed, its journey was from humble beginnings. I think it was in the late  1940s that Colin Chapman was first in a lock-up garage developing a trial  racing car, but that has led all the way to a globally renowned company  manufacturing high-performance products.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">This is a business that has always been at the cutting  edge. It makes an important contribution to the UK automotive sector, not just  through the exports of its iconic cars but through the world-class design  engineering to which my hon. Friend referred, which, although particularly  relevant to the automotive sector, is—as he said—also relevant throughout the  engineering field. Lotus is a globally respected business which works with many  of the world’s most prestigious car manufacturers and tier 1 suppliers. Lotus  engineers spearhead research in crucial areas such as hybrids, electric  vehicles and renewable fuels, which is one of the reasons why many people  understand that the business has a very strong future.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The Government believe that the company’s work must  continue and that it should continue in Norfolk, but, as a number of Members  have pointed out, it is important to view Lotus in its wider context. This  country has one of the most diverse and competitive automotive sectors in the  world. When considering the prospects of both individual businesses and the  sector as a whole, we should take account of the key investments that have been  made. Some £4 billion has been invested in the last 18 months. That sends the  important signal that international investors recognise the calibre of the work  force, and also the opportunities that they can gain by basing their firms  here.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The sector is strong and growing. Vehicle production has  risen by 5% in the last year, and more than 1.4 million vehicles have been  produced. Engine production has also increased. I am thinking particularly of  the strength of powertrain in the UK automotive sector: some 2.5 million units  have been produced in the last year. One of the encouraging features of the  whole sector is that not only is its productivity strong and its work force  capable, but it exports a significant proportion—some 80%-—of what it produces.  Last year exports were up by 15%, and they are now at an all-time cash high of  just short of £30 billion. Lotus is part of that: last year it recorded  production of 1,458 cars of which 1,189 were for export, so it clearly has a  strong export programme.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Despite a difficult international economic environment  and a contracting European market, global demand for UK-made vehicles has  risen, which shows that UK 
    producers are generating what customers throughout the  world are looking for. That is why our car trade deficit is at its lowest for  more than 36 years. There are a number of good examples. Nissan has invested  £250 million, creating the possibility of some 3,000 new jobs in both its own  business and its supply chain. Jaguar Land Rover has announced that it will  take on a further 1,000 people and increase shifts at its Halewood plant. Honda  is to double production at its main European plant in Swindon. Those are all  important investments in the sector. It is important for everyone—both the  existing sector and potential investors—to understand that the UK automotive  sector has real strength and depth, and is backed by a Government who are  actively supporting those who seek to invest here in the United Kingdom.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">My hon. Friend briefly mentioned ultra-low-carbon  vehicles. As he said, Lotus is a key participant in that regard, as it clear  from its world-class range-extended electric vehicle technology and its role in  the development of the important emerging technology of hydrogen fuel cells.  The Government are pursuing a programme which seeks to ensure that we have a  marketplace in which those technologies can develop, because we cannot assume  that past technologies will be revived. As the new generations of  ultra-low-carbon vehicles develop, it is important for those who wish to invest  to recognise that the expertise and know-how are resident here.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Let me turn to the details of the current situation,  which my hon. Friend mentioned. The takeover by the Malaysian company DRB-HICOM  of Lotus’s parent, Proton, was begun in January, as we heard, and completed  around the middle of March. DRB-HICOM is one of Malaysia’s leading companies;  indeed, it is the country’s leading automotive manufacturer. Its values, stated  clearly and openly, include excellence, innovation, quality and teamwork. Since  then, DRB-HICOM has been carrying out what we understand to be standard due  diligence checks on Lotus and other assets related to its takeover of Proton.  As my hon. Friend mentioned, the Prime Minister raised the issue of Group Lotus  with the Malaysian Prime Minister and Proton while he was in Malaysia recently.  He stressed, as I do today, that the Government continue to wish to work with  the company.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">In response to media speculation, DRB-HICOM issued a  press statement last Saturday stating that no decision had been taken on  whether to sell Lotus. In the meantime, DRB-HICOM has also stated that it  continues to support the company, including through management help. I understand  that additional funds have been made available by DRB-HICOM to enable Lotus to  resume production while the due diligence continues. That would follow on from  the £100 million invested in Lotus at Hethel in recent years.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> May I ask my hon. Friend to interrogate closely the  question of how much support is being provided so that manufacturing can  “resume”, as he puts it? My understanding is that DRB-HICOM is drip-feeding  small amounts of cash to the business, that there is little manufacturing going  on and that there might not be too much manufacturing going on in future unless  we are careful. If he could press the Malaysians—indeed, the Government of  Malaysia—on that point, so that they put pressure on DRB-HICOM to reach a  resolution in the interests of workers in Norfolk, I would be very grateful.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Mr Prisk:</strong> I am more than happy, as we continue our close contact  with the companies, to ensure that those questions are tested. My hon. Friend  will know that I do not generally take no for an answer, and I intend to ensure  that we as a Government have the full facts before us.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">My hon. Friend is right that although the statements we  have heard are important, we also need to recognise that this is a rather  unsettling time for the work force, their families and the business community  locally. Let me make it clear to him that we as a Government—all the Ministers  engaged—intend to maintain close contact with all the key stakeholders. That is  why the British high commissioner in Malaysia recently wrote to Proton,  following on from the Prime Minister’s meeting. It is also why this afternoon  the Secretary of State spoke to Mr Dany Bahar, the Lotus chief executive,  making it clear to him that the Government are fully behind ensuring that the company  and its work force remain an integral part of the Norfolk economy. The  Government will seek to make further contacts with the Malaysian Government, as  my hon. Friend requested, because we recognise that we need to be talking at  all levels on this important issue.</p>
  <p align="left">Let me turn briefly to the regional growth fund. My hon.  Friend will understand that we have made a conditional offer of financial  support for Lotus’s growth plans. That offer has been on hold since the  acquisition of Proton by DRB-HICOM in January. We have made it   clear to Proton and the companies that the Government  stand ready to reactivate the RGF grant offer—subject to the normal due  diligence—but only if the vehicle development programme goes ahead in Norfolk.  That is an important principle to establish.</p>
  <p align="left">  I thank my hon. Friend for bringing this important issue  to the attention of the House. I understand that this is an unsettling time for  the employees, and I trust that the situation will be clarified shortly. I want  to make it clear again that the Government wish to see Lotus continuing to  build on its rich industrial heritage in Norfolk, and we stand ready to use the  regional growth fund if it seeks to do that. In conclusion, Ministers at the  highest level are taking the matter very seriously. I can tell my hon. Friends  here this evening that we will remain in close contact with the companies and  will work to ensure that the new owners understand that Norfolk is the home of  Lotus.<br>
