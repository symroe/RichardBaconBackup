		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk):</b> I join the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) 
		in saying that the people of our area feel neglected compared with those 
		of other parts of the country. Although the eastern region as a whole 
		has done well economically, that economic benefit is concentrated more 
		in the west of the region, around the Cambridge corridor, than in the 
		east. When I went to Blackpool for my party's conference I found that I 
		would save two hours by taking the train from Norwich to London and 
		thence to Blackpool, instead of going direct from Norwich to Blackpool. 
		That shows what neglect our area has suffered. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Further to the hon. 
		Gentleman's remarks about Lowestoft, I have a good sense of how far east 
		it is because when I was growing up in Worcestershire we used to visit 
		my grandparents in Lowestoft. It was the most interminable journey that 
		I ever had to undertake as a child. Points east in Norfolk as well as 
		Suffolk are disconnected. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Great Yarmouth. 
		We all look forward to the development of the Yarmouth outer harbour and 
		the contribution that it will make to reviving the eastern part of East 
		Anglia. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We are delighted 
		that work on the section of the A11 from Roudham Heath to Attleborough 
		is going ahead and that the Government have announced their preferred routes for the remainder. I understand 
		that there will be one public inquiry to take account of both routes. 
		That news highlights the problem of time scales. I am told that, if 
		things go smoothly, the earliest that we can expect construction to 
		start is 2005 and that dualling of the A11 will not be complete until 
		2007. That is six years—as long as it took to fight the second world 
		war. There seems to be a wider policy point to be made about the length 
		of time that planning inquiries take. However, we are grateful that 
		progress is being made, albeit slowly. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">What is the 
		Government's current policy on bypasses? The residents of Long Stratton, 
		in my constituency, are desperate for a bypass. I invite the Minister to 
		visit Long Stratton to see what they put up with. The A140 from Norwich 
		to Ipswich runs through the centre of that small town and 45,000 cars a 
		day use it. That is wholly inappropriate. The problem has festered for 
		years and we look forward to a rapid solution. The county council will 
		consult on the issue next year and when the process is complete it will 
		assemble a bid for a major project. I hope that the Government will look 
		favourably on that when the time comes. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We should not forget 
		the other kinds of transport that are available. Norwich airport, just 
		outside my constituency, is a vital resource for the area, and for many 
		people is much closer than flying from Stansted airport in the west of 
		the eastern region. The national media sometimes do not bring out the 
		difference between what is happening in the east of the eastern region 
		and what is happening in the west of the region. I hope that the 
		Government will bear in mind, especially in relation to the Cambridge to 
		Huntingdon multi-modal study, the fact that economic development of the 
		region requires better transport links in the east too. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The hon. Member for 
		Waveney spoke about environmental links and striking the right balance. 
		That relates to a more general point that environmental protection can 
		be afforded only if there is wealth. It is not an accident that the 
		poorest countries tend to have the least environmental protection. 
		Greater economic prosperity means that we can better afford to enhance 
		the environment. <br>
