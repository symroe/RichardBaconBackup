</span></h3>
<hr size="1" id="line"><br><p class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given 
			as part of an adjournment debate in Westminster 
			Hall the House of Commons, 
			on 16 January 2007</cite></p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon 
    (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> I am very pleased to have the opportunity 
    to present this debate on the Government&#8217;s prosecuting policy on 
    induced car accidents.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">An induced car accident happens when 
    fraudsters who wish to claim from an insurance company drive motor 
    vehicles to busy road junctions where they perform unexpected, 
    unnecessary and dangerous emergency stops designed to cause innocent 
    members of the public to crash into them. There are several favoured 
    methods. Some disconnect the brake lights of their vehicle and then 
    brake sharply in moving traffic once a victim is positioned behind. 
    Others pull on to roundabouts from busy slip roads, then brake 
    sharply once six to 10 feet over the line.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">By forcing victims to crash into them from 
    behind, under current insurance law, fraudsters can rely on a 
    virtually automatic admission of liability by the victim&#8217;s insurers. 
    They then submit multiple insurance claims&#8212;for personal injury, loss 
    of earnings and so on&#8212;on behalf of the driver and multiple fake 
    passengers, who are members of the criminal gang. If undetected, a 
    single crash can net as much as £30,000 for the gang.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">What is the scale of the problem? Research by 
    the Insurance Fraud Bureau indicates that since 1999 over 22,500 
    fraudulent motor accidents have taken place throughout the country. 
    The scam was first detected in the north of England, and insurers 
    are now aware of gangs operating in many large UK cities and towns. 
    Recently, there has been prolific growth in such activity in London 
    and the south east. In 2003, insurers were aware of just four 
    criminal gangs operating in the UK, but by November 2006, that had 
    grown to 40, with an average of three new gangs being detected per 
    month. Industry experience has shown that, once well established, 
    such gangs can potentially induce 300 to 400 accidents per year. The 
    problem is huge and growing.</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale) (Con):</b> I 
    congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Does he agree 
    that fraud is never a victimless crime &#8212; particularly insurance 
    fraud &#8212; because we all pay through the premiums resulting from the 
    fraudulent claims? Furthermore, does he share my concern that 
    induced accidents are a serious threat to public safety and that 
    innocent people could become embroiled in an accident resulting in 
    serious injury or loss of life? That element stamps this as a real 
    menace that must be tackled by the Government, the police and 
    insurers in partnership.</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> I am pleased that my hon. 
    Friend raised that point. The threat to public safety is the single 
    biggest problem. Of course, there are other issues, such as rising 
    motor insurance premiums. I know that he has taken a big interest in 
    the matter, as the chairman of the all-party group on insurance and 
    financial services. He is right: the very serious and growing threat 
    to public safety is the single biggest issue. Serious injuries such 
    as broken limbs and crushed rib cages can occur, and have done. If 
    the fraud is allowed to continue, there will almost certainly be 
    fatalities and a growing injury rate.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">Some evidence suggests that women driving 
    alone and those on the school run with children are targeted by 
    fraudsters because they think that they are more likely to admit 
    liability. As my hon. Friend said, these crimes are forcing 
    insurance premiums to rise, which is paid for by innocent motorists, 
    and insurers estimate that the fraud is now yielding at least £200 
    million a year for organised criminals. The phenomenon is growing so 
    quickly, however, that that could be a significant underestimate. We 
    are talking about many hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">That links directly to the third issue: cash 
    generated from the fraud is fuelling the growth of organised crime. 
    Norwich Union referred to that in its 2005 fraud report, &#8220;Shedding 
    Light on Hidden Crime&#8221;. Insurers believe that the proceeds from 
    induced car accidents are being used routinely to fund other forms 
    of organised crime, including drugs and people trafficking, benefits 
    and credit card fraud and money laundering. It might even be funding 
    terrorism. Induced accident fraud started among predominantly Muslim 
    gangs in the north of England, but has now spread so widely that 
    criminals from all backgrounds are involved.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">It remains the case, however, that the gangs 
    that started the earliest and so acquired the most expertise have 
    been the most successful in perpetrating the fraud. That is 
    reflected geographically in the figures for the number of staged 
    accidents. The Insurance Fraud Bureau has estimated that since 1999 
    there have been 22,605 staged or induced accidents, and has broken 
    them down city by city. Blackburn comes top, with 1,710 staged 
    accidents since 1999&#8212;7.5 per cent. of the total. Bradford and 
    Birmingham come next, followed by Oldham. Those four cities alone 
    account for more than a quarter of all such crashes. Bolton, 
    Manchester, Liverpool and Preston come next and bring the total to 
    more than 42 per cent.&#8212;some 9,500 crashes. The Serious Organised 
    Crime Agency monitors terrorists&#8217; finances. I hope that the 
    Solicitor-General can tell us that the agency is aware of those 
    figures, which indicate a significant concentration in a small 
    number of northern cities where Asian gangs &#8212; they are predominantly 
    Muslim &#8212; started this fraud.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">I shall examine the reasons for the quick 
    growth of the fraud. Before 2006, the police were generally unable 
    to investigate these organised gangs. Typical cited reasons for not 
    doing so are limited resources or the low prioritisation of fraud in 
    the national policing plan &#8212; no targets were set. This fraud has 
    been an extremely profitable and almost risk-free activity, so it 
    would have been extraordinary if it had been ignored by organised 
    crime. Since 2006, with the growing focus on fraud as a national 
    issue, police forces in the south of England have begun to 
    investigate more cases of such fraud. In notable cases, prosecutions 
    are ongoing. To date, however, no police force in the north of 
    England, where this problem started and is most prolific, has 
    investigated a single case. Consequently, the vast majority of the 
    40 known gangs operating&nbsp;&nbsp; in the UK are not under 
    investigation.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">I remind hon. Members that it took six to 
    seven years to generate more than 22,000 crashes. The Insurance 
    Fraud Bureau believes that at the current rate of growth, a further 
    20,000 crashes will be generated over the next 18 months. Another 
    reason for the growth is that the crime is so profitable and easy 
    that it is now being franchised. Insurers have obtained intelligence 
    that they believe indicates that the largest and most prolific gang 
    in the north-east is effectively selling franchises to other gangs, 
    providing support, set-up and driver training. I am given to 
    understand that requests to investigate the gang have been refused 
    routinely by the relevant police authorities.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">I shall examine the implications for the 
    policing and prosecuting authorities. It is a national problem 
    requiring a structured national response. In my view, any 
    significant delay represents an unacceptable risk to public safety. 
    Without the consistent threat of prosecution across the UK, 
    experience has shown that the problem will continue to grow. Police 
    targets are set on the basis of harm caused to individuals and 
    society by a particular crime. That approach makes a strong case for 
    making the prosecution of induced accident fraud an immediate 
    priority &#8212; it poses a direct risk to public safety, funds organised 
    crime and possibly terrorism, and impacts on society through higher 
    motor insurance premiums and the rate at which the problem is 
    growing.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">In my view, a case could be made also for the 
    immediate ring-fencing of police anti-fraud resources around the UK, 
    as recommended by the Attorney-General in his excellent fraud review 
    last year. Without that, we can reasonably expect a continued 
    erosion of specialised police anti-fraud resources. In the past 
    decade, available resources for combating fraud outside London have 
    been halved. Last year, at the request of the Home Office, following 
    representations from the insurance industry, an evidence-based 
    threat assessment was submitted to the Home Office by the 
    Association of British Insurers detailing and quantifying the threat 
    to the UK of induced accidents and requesting urgent and 
    co-ordinated action from law enforcement agencies.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">That has been superseded by more recent 
    research by the newly formed Insurance Fraud Bureau indicating that 
    the problem is significantly larger than first thought. Details of 
    that research were presented to the all-party group on insurance and 
    financial services, chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for 
    Ryedale, and subsequently shared with MPs from affected 
    constituencies. I would like clarification from the Government on a 
    number of questions. First, who in the Government is responsible for 
    considering the implications of the research and deciding on an 
    appropriate course of action? Secondly, is such consideration 
    ongoing, and if so, when will a decision be reached? Thirdly, will 
    the relevant Minister advise us on the action to be taken to combat 
    the national problem of induced accidents and on how the Government 
    intend to stop its prolific growth? Fourthly, will that Minister 
    agree to meet with the Association of Chief Police Officers to 
    discuss how to prioritise the arrest and prosecution of such gangs 
    before the problem escalates out of all proportion?</p>
  <p class="speechbody">Induced accident fraud is just one example of 
    the wider problem of fraud. Its recent growth is connected to low 
    awareness of fraud and the fact that it has not been a national 
    policing priority. However, it is important to say that good work is 
    now being done. I applaud both the growing efforts of our police in 
    the south-east and the excellent work done by the Attorney-General&#8217;s 
    fraud review team.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">Almost overnight, our perception of the 
    problem has changed. For example, the Attorney-General&#8217;s review 
    concluded that fraud as a crime is perhaps second only to class A 
    drugs in the harm that it does nationally. Induced accident fraud is 
    only one of the many rapidly growing methods of fraud facing us, 
    which include VAT fraud, benefit fraud, credit card fraud and 
    corporate fraud. I welcome the Attorney-General&#8217;s review of fraud 
    and support its recommendations, which once implemented will lay the 
    foundations of a more fraud-resistant economy and society. I await 
    the Government&#8217;s response to those recommendations and would welcome 
    active steps to ensure that they are implemented as soon as 
    possible. The Attorney-General&#8217;s report recognised that there are 
    currently no up-to-date statistics on the extent and impact of fraud 
    on the UK. I await with interest the ACPO study to measure that, 
    which I believe is due to be published next month. Perhaps the 
    Solicitor-General could tell us whether he has met the 
    Attorney-General to discuss the recommendations of the fraud review 
    and say what hope he has that the recommendations will be 
    implemented.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">I have focused most of my remarks in this 
    debate on induced accident fraud, so I hope that the 
    Solicitor-General will concentrate primarily on that in his reply. I 
    hope that I have persuaded him of the seriousness of the issue. 
    Induced accident fraud is one of the most startling forms of fraud. 
    It targets innocent motorists in a disgraceful way, and is a 
    significant and growing threat to public safety. It offers organised 
    criminal gangs easy pickings that are nearly risk-free for the 
    fraudsters. Although some police forces are now taking an interest, 
    there is a long way to go. There are large parts of the country, 
    particularly in the north of England, where the organised criminal 
    gangs undertaking the fraud are unimpeded and uninvestigated, and 
    can operate with virtually zero risk of prosecution. Finally, the 
    proceeds of such crimes are used to finance more organised crime. 
    This cannot continue.</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>The Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) on 
    securing this debate on an issue that I agree demands greater public 
    awareness. The insurance industry has been aware of it for some 
    time, but only a relatively short time, in the sense that such fraud 
    has grown quite spectacularly in recent months and years. I also 
    welcome the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), who has taken a 
    keen interest in such issues.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">The Government take seriously the increasing 
    prevalence of induced car accidents and their effect on communities. 
    Innocent road users &#8212; they are often mothers taking their children 
    to school in the morning, who might be seen as easy victims, as the 
    hon. Member for South Norfolk pointed out &#8212; face physical injury, 
    emotional trauma and the shock of having an accident, perhaps in the 
    middle of a busy roundabout, which is a favourite location for 
    induced accidents. The victims of such fraud also face damage to 
    their vehicle and the inconvenience of having to deal with the 
    accident and their child, who might be very upset, as well as the 
    loss of their no claims bonus and increased premiums. All that means 
    that individuals can be quite badly affected by induced accidents. 
    The general public are also at risk and need to be aware of the 
    problem, because all of us who drive cars face increased insurance 
    premiums as a result of the growing problem.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">We are also aware that some of the money that 
    is paid to the criminals might be diverted to other kinds of 
    criminal activity. I do not have any evidence that it is diverted 
    towards terrorism, but no doubt other criminals have used it for 
    various purposes.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">The way in which we address the problem must 
    involve three key elements. First, there must be a response by the 
    authorities, particularly the police and the Crown Prosecution 
    Service. Secondly, the insurance companies must recognise, as they 
    are doing, their responsibility to focus on claims that happen in 
    the sorts of circumstances in which induced accidents may occur, 
    ensuring that their investigators focus on particular incidents, 
    gather the evidence and, if appropriate, refer the matter to the 
    police. Thirdly, we need the public to be aware when they have 
    accidents of the sorts of circumstances in which such incidents 
    arise. Those concerned need to ask themselves whether they have had 
    a real accident or whether, when they were trying to get on to that 
    roundabout, the guy in front of them just pulled out and jammed on 
    the brakes. The victim might not have seen any brake lights because 
    the lights had been disconnected and because they were watching the 
    cars coming from the right, round the roundabout. That is one of the 
    ways in which such fraud is perpetrated.</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> The Solicitor-General is 
    absolutely right to say that there needs to be attention by the 
    authorities, the public and the insurance companies. That might 
    eventually lead to a change in a technical aspect of insurance law, 
    which has always assumed that the car hitting from behind is guilty. 
    The insurance companies have done a great deal in recent years, 
    appointing investigators, gathering evidence and secretly filming 
    such incidents. However, does the Solicitor-General accept that even 
    when the insurance companies have presented the prosecuting 
    authorities with evidentially sound bundles, with pink ribbons 
    around them, and said, &#8220;There, prosecute that&#8221;, they have found 
    resistance? That is one of the problems.</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> I cannot accept 
    that, because I do not have any evidence for it. However, the hon. 
    Gentleman says so and no doubt he has been informed of that by the 
    insurance companies. If he has evidence that that has occurred, I 
    should be happy to look at it and talk to the CPS about why that 
    might have occurred, or to the Home Office, if the police have felt 
    unable to conduct such investigations. However, I entirely accept 
    the view, which has been increasingly put to us in consultations 
    with the Association of British Insurers and the insurance industry 
    more generally, that induced accident fraud is a growing problem. It 
    puts innocent individuals at risk and is a growing criminal issue 
    that needs to be addressed.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">I am concerned by the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s 
    references to police in the north of England. I agree that some of 
    the problems appear to have arisen initially in West Yorkshire. The 
    issue came to our attention in early 2005, with a spate of accidents 
    in West Yorkshire that followed a similar pattern. However, 
    prosecutions are also taking place in a number of counties in the 
    south of England. There is a growing awareness of the problem by the 
    police, and I suspect that we shall see an increasing focus on it in 
    the months to come.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">Key actions for the police service, as set out 
    in the recently published national community safety plan, include 
    the need to have strategies to address all major threats, including 
    fraud. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that fraud is 
    currently not one of the key policing indicators. We always have to 
    be careful about how many targets we set for public services. He 
    will be aware of the criticisms that his party has made of the 
    number of targets that are presented to public authorities. We need 
    to hold discussions with the police about how they deal with such 
    issues, and about where KPIs and other targets have a role. However, 
    the national community safety plan includes references to fraud, and 
    we have flagged up with the police the need to deal with it.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s comments about 
    the fraud review, which the Attorney-General conducted recently, and 
    the close work that has been undertaken between our Department and 
    the insurance industry to examine some of the issues that it faces 
    to do with fraud. The results of the review have been broadly 
    welcomed by the insurance industry and I hope that that will make a 
    significant change.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">Another thing that will make significant 
    change is yesterday&#8217;s introduction into law of the Fraud Act 2006. 
    That is significant, not only because of some of the increased 
    penalties&#8212;in one case doubling the penalty for fraud from five years 
    on indictment to10 years&#8212;but because it will make it easier to focus 
    on the reality of the fraud rather than on the technical problems of 
    implementing some of the fraud-related provisions of theft 
    legislation. I hope that that new legislation, which I helped take 
    through the House of Commons, will help to enable the police and 
    prosecuting authorities to focus more effectively on such crime.</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> The Solicitor-General&#8217;s 
    point about KPIs is well taken; there is a limit to how many targets 
    we can have. Lately, Lord Browne of Madingley was in the news, 
    saying that no organisation should have more than 10 targets&#8212;he was 
    referring to BP, of course&#8212;and that if it has, it will be lucky to 
    achieve six of them.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">However, if police targets are set on the 
    basis of harm, and if the Attorney-General&#8217;s view is that the harm 
    caused by fraud is second only to that of class A drugs, surely 
    there is a case for reviewing the national police priorities and 
    considering whether fraud ought to be moved up, perhaps at the 
    expense of something else? Fraud is a national policing priority in 
    Scotland. Will the Solicitor-General consider the case for 
    introducing fraud as a national policing priority?</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> For a 
    considerable time, there have been all sorts of discussions about 
    what the key policing indicators should be. Fraud has been discussed 
    in that context; it was when I was at the Home Office some years 
    ago. Such discussions with the police are always difficult, because 
    they know that they are only able to focus on particular issues.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">We want to ensure that fraud is dealt with as 
    a key issue without it necessarily having to be one of the KPIs. 
    However, we shall discuss the matter again with the police in due 
    course. Let us ensure that we have the appropriate focus to deal 
    with the problem of induced accidents. As I have already indicated 
    in the national community safety plan, we regard that as important. 
    It is a growing problem, and I welcome the fact that this debate has 
    enabled me to raise its importance.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">We have consulted the Association of British 
    Insurers, which estimates that there could be as many as 10,000 
    induced accidents a year, costing us more than £200 million in 
    insurance. Such fraud impacts on us all, as insurance fraud alone 
    puts our car insurance premiums up by about 5 per cent. Under the 
    Fraud Act 2006, police and prosecutors will be able to use modern 
    and flexible statutory offences to help ensure that criminals who 
    stage accidents to commit fraud are brought to justice. I am very 
    pleased that such provisions became law yesterday.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">The recently published fraud review suggests 
    how the Government and industry can work together to fight fraud. 
    The insurance industry is undertaking an identification of fraud and 
    seeking to develop its means of dealing with the problem. The review 
    team worked closely with the Association of British Insurers and its 
    recommendations presented a range of proposals, from prevention 
    through to investigation and prosecution.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">It is important that there should be a 
    sufficient criminal justice response to staged accident fraud. The 
    police and the CPS fully appreciate the seriousness of staged 
    traffic accidents, because of not only the criminal offences and 
    sums of money involved but the real and serious danger to road users 
    and the impact on the innocent motorists and passengers targeted by 
    such criminals.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">The CPS and the police are working closely 
    together on such cases. When such serious allegations are made, the 
    CPS is responsible for authorising the police to charge suspects. 
    Advice from the CPS is increasingly sought by the police at the 
    earliest stages of investigation; prompt action is being taken to 
    restrain assets. Case management systems are now being set up from 
    the outset to assist in the compilation and analysis of evidence and 
    the conduct of court proceedings.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">However, the CPS must review each case on its 
    merits. We need the evidence and to ensure that it is in the public 
    interest to prosecute. Cases of induced accident will normally be in 
    the public interest, because they are an increasing problem with 
    which the criminal justice system has to deal. Any conviction is 
    likely to result in a substantial sentence that will include 
    compensation and confiscation.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">In December 2006, the CPS launched its public 
    consultation on bad driving. Many of the responses are from members 
    of the public who have been involved in traffic accidents. Their 
    accounts of the incidents and their impact on them and their 
    families highlight the significant consequences of even the most 
    minor of unavoidable accidents, let alone more serious collisions 
    and the induced accidents that we are discussing today. </p>
  <p class="speechbody">We know that the various fraudsters involved 
    in induced accidents get a significant amount of money. The average 
    insurance bill for such accidents is £25,000 to £30,000, and the 
    total cost to the industry in 2005 was estimated at in excess of 
    £200 million. The issue is significant, and we need to address it. 
    Induced or staged accidents are not just about insurance companies, 
    fraud or the money, but collisions and injuries to individuals.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">We must recognise not only the insurance 
    industry&#8217;s problems, but the difficulty and pain inflicted on 
    individuals whose lives are put at risk by such criminals. We need 
    to raise public awareness and ensure that insurance companies are 
    establishing appropriate ways of dealing with the issue. I agree 
    with the hon. Member for South Norfolk that the insurance companies 
    are now putting the appropriate responses in place and ensuring that 
    their investigators are conscious of the need to deal with such 
    issues. The companies are putting in place mechanisms to enable them 
    to put together evidence.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">I want to ensure that there is greater 
    co-operation between the police, the CPS and insurance companies and 
    a greater awareness among the public. If someone is the victim of 
    what they think was an accident, they should think about whether it 
    was that or something far worse. If that conjunction of elements can 
    be brought together, we will have a fair chance of seriously coming 
    to grips with a new but growing problem.</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> The Solicitor-General is 
    generous in giving way. I am encouraged by some of his words; he is 
    right in saying that the problem requires work and effort from 
    everyone, including the public.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">Lawyers have considered and tested the 
    evidence for some such cases and found it to be sound and robust. 
    They have considered the case robust, but there have been 
    difficulties in persuading the CPS or the police to take it forward. 
    Would the Solicitor-General be happy to consider those evidence 
    bundles to establish whether the cases should go forward?</p>
  <p class="speechbody"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> I hesitate to 
    agree to investigate and take an individual view on what might be 
    hundreds and hundreds of cases. We employ the CPS to consider 
    evidence; the police assess evidence and put it together for the 
    CPS. It is not for Ministers to try to usurp those roles. None the 
    less, it is important that, when the evidence offers a realistic 
    prospect for prosecution, such cases are properly considered, 
    investigated and dealt with.</p>
  <p class="speechbody">A chief constable has to take a view on the 
    appropriate allocation of his officers&#8217; time and effort and it would 
    not be appropriate for me to say to particular chief constables, 
    &#8220;You must allocate your police officers&#8217; time in this way.&#8221; We must 
    give some authority to chief constables and ensure that cases are 
    dealt with properly. It is also essential that the public, the 
    police and the CPS are aware of induced accidents and that, together 
    with insurance companies, they all get their acts together to ensure 
    that we deal with them.</p>
