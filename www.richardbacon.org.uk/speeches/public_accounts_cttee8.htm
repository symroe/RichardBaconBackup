			Commons on 15 May 2008 as part of the Public Accounts Committee 
			debate</cite></p>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> It 
		is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. 
		Mitchell). He is a colourful member of the Committee, and he certainly 
		enlivens our proceedings. It was also interesting for me personally to 
		hear him confirm what I had long suspected&#8212;that he cranes over to look 
		at my notes in order to steal my best questions. I am glad that he has 
		finally &#8220;fessed up&#8221; to that.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I too pay tribute to Sir John Bourn, the recently 
		retired Comptroller and Auditor General. He has rendered the country an 
		extraordinary service in the way in which he has led the National Audit 
		Office over the past 20 years, and the way in which he has built it up. 
		He has done nothing less than create a world leader among supreme audit 
		institutions. We need only speak to people in those institutions to 
		understand that that is their view of the NAO. Having visited the 
		Bundesrechnungshof in Germany, the Cour des Comptes in Paris, the 
		Tribunal de Cuentas in Madrid, the Government Accountability Office in 
		Washington and the Kyrgyzstani national audit institution in Bishkek&#8212;I 
		will not try to pronounce its name&#8212;I can confirm, on the basis of 
		worldwide experience, that the NAO is held in very high regard. I also 
		pay tribute to Sir John Bourn&#8217;s successor, Tim Burr, and to the entire 
		staff of the NAO. As our Chairman said, we could not possibly do our 
		work without them.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Before I deal with the reports that are the 
		subject of the motion, let me briefly discuss the terms of the motion 
		itself, which require the debate to be confined to the reports from our 
		Committee&#8212;named and numbered on the Order Paper&#8212;to which the Treasury 
		has issued a minute in reply. There are good reasons for that, in 
		particular that it ensures that the Treasury Minister&#8212;in this case, our 
		distinguished colleague the Exchequer Secretary&#8212;can be properly briefed 
		and give informed answers. It might also be argued that it prevents the 
		debate from drifting off in too many different directions&#8212;although I 
		think that our friend the hon. Member for Great Grimsby has proved that 
		wrong. However, we are in any case discussing 32 different reports, 
		whose subjects vary from the coal health compensation scheme to the 
		Icelandic trawler compensation scheme; from costs in primary care to use 
		of the Heritage Lottery Fund; and from the recovery of the ill-gotten 
		assets of criminals to the management of sickness absence in the 
		Department for Transport, so the argument that the motion as constructed 
		stops the debate going off in lots of different directions is a 
		non-starter, as that is in the nature of what we do.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The key question for me is whether the terms of 
		the motion restrict the topicality of our debate in a way that is 
		unhelpful to the public interest and to effective scrutiny by Parliament 
		of what the Government do. I think that they do, and although I do not 
		want to make too much of this point, I shall give two brief examples of 
		why that is the case before I move on to discuss the reports listed in 
		the motion.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The national programme for IT in the health 
		service is an ongoing concern of the Public Accounts Committee, the NAO 
		and commentators on health IT. It is the world&#8217;s largest health 
		technology programme, and it is not unfair to say that it is in serious 
		trouble. A report will be published on the subject tomorrow. It is a 
		curious fact that in the last of these PAC debates we could, and did, 
		refer to the NHS IT project, whereas we could not do so in the one 
		before that. If your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, was sufficiently acute in 
		attending to the 32 reports on our list for today, you will be aware 
		that we cannot refer to it. It seems rather arbitrary that in some 
		debates we can and in some we cannot, when this concern is both long 
		running and ongoing. There have been developments since our last debate. 
		Ministers have made statements about the timetable for the deployment of 
		systems into acute hospital trusts, and there have been problems with 
		slippage on those timetables. It would be appropriate and topical to be 
		able to talk about that, but it is not technically in order to do so.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">My second example involves Postcomm and the 
		regulatory framework that Royal Mail works under. We have frequently 
		looked at regulators, including Postcomm; we did so most recently 
		yesterday. This is an important issue for our constituents. In 
		particular, the maintenance of the universal service obligation, which 
		has been referred to, is a matter of great importance in rural areas 
		such as my constituency, and it has also been a matter of some 
		controversy in the press recently, as Postcomm has commissioned an 
		economic consultancy firm to study the costs underlying the universal 
		service obligation&#8212;or, to be accurate, some of those costs, because it 
		failed to include the international component. It would be good to be 
		able to raise this matter, and to hear the Treasury&#8217;s thoughts on it. 
		Once again, however, it is outside the terms of the motion. That seems a 
		little odd given that yesterday we could discuss it in Committee, and 
		that this morning the chairman of Postcomm went on Radio 4 and said that 
		a universal service obligation that is viable for the future is most 
		likely to be achieved through a radical transformation of the governance 
		and structure of the Royal Mail, including the introduction of private 
		capital to safeguard the universal service obligation. The best 
		adjective to describe that remark might be &#8220;startling&#8221;, and it at least 
		seems worthy of debate&#8212;and debate now. However, we cannot discuss that.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">For future debates, I propose the slight change&#8212;I 
		would be interested to know what the Exchequer Secretary thinks of 
		this&#8212;that we add that the House takes note not only of the numbered 
		reports and the Treasury minutes, but of &#8220;the work of the National Audit 
		Office and of the Public Accounts Committee in general.&#8221; This is not an 
		attempt to catch the Treasury out. It will plainly be the case that the 
		Minister who appears before us will want to talk about our most recent 
		reports, and the Treasury employs some very bright civil servants&#8212;it 
		attracts some of our brightest university graduates&#8212;and I think they are 
		more than capable of briefing Ministers on the work of the NAO and the 
		Committee in general.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I must say to the Exchequer Secretary that we miss 
		her on the Committee. She is still a member of it ex officio, but when 
		she was a full-blown member she was a very incisive questioner, and I 
		have no doubt that were we to have a more wide-ranging debate, 
		technically speaking, she would have no difficulty at all in coping with 
		it, and I doubt whether any of her Treasury colleagues would either.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">With those preliminary remarks, may I turn to some 
		of the reports detailed in the motion? The first one that I wish to 
		discuss is &#8220;Building for the future: Sustainable construction and 
		refurbishment on the government estate&#8221;. The NAO&#8217;s trend of increasingly 
		examining real estate issues in Government is a welcome one. We examined 
		the national health service estate a while ago, and we have examined 
		property issues across different Departments. There are huge potential 
		benefits for the Government in managing those estates more efficiently.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I wish to raise one particular recommendation with 
		the Exchequer Secretary. Recommendation 4 states:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Departments are 
		failing to implement Treasury guidance and assess costs and benefits of 
		sustainable design options&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">What I want to ask her touches not so much on 
		sustainable design options but on the generic question of Treasury 
		guidance. The Treasury issues guidance on a range of subjects, and I am 
		interested in understanding what the Treasury does to ensure that that 
		is followed.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The theme that one finds repeatedly across Departments&#8212;we examine £600 
		billion or £700 billion of income and expenditure across virtually every 
		public sector activity&#8212;is that guidance, advice and clear instruction 
		was given as to what ought to happen, but that it just did not happen. 
		Does the Treasury just rely on the NAO, which, after all, in its earlier 
		incarnation was the Exchequer and Audit Department, to check that its 
		guidance is being followed? Alternatively, do the responsible policy 
		desk officers in the Treasury covering different Departments have an 
		ongoing responsibility to check that what they say should be done is 
		being done. I have had a deep suspicion for a long time that perhaps it 
		is not that, as people often say, the Treasury is too powerful, but that 
		it is not powerful and big enough, and that we need a stronger centre.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The second report that I wish to discuss dealt with maintaining river 
		and coastal flood defences. Recommendation 2 stated:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;There are significant 
		shortcomings in the Agency&#8217;s&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">&#8212;the Environment Agency&#8212;</p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220; ability to prioritise 
		expenditure on the highest risk areas and assets.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Prioritising expenditure is an absolute basic for any Department or 
		Government agency, so why does a significant and important agency, such 
		as the Environment Agency, have such difficulty doing something as basic 
		as prioritising expenditure? Once again, what is the Treasury doing 
		about the situation&#8212;I hope that someone is doing something&#8212;to ensure 
		that that lesson is being learnt elsewhere and that people are capable 
		of prioritising expenditure in the way that they should?</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I commend the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) on confining his 
		speech to the issue of dementia. I thought that our hearing on dementia 
		was one of our most important in that Session. Professor Bannerjee, one 
		of the chief witnesses, was an exceptional witness. The right hon. 
		Gentleman made the point that is covered in recommendation 2, which 
		states:</p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Unlike cancer and 
		coronary heart disease there is no single individual with responsibility 
		or accountability for improving dementia services.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Treasury&#8217;s minutes of reply state that it is considering</p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;as part of the 
		strategy work whether there is a compelling case for a national clinical 
		director.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That reply was published at the end of March, but our hearing took place 
		in October, so six months had passed in between. I distinctly recall the 
		officials before us saying at the time that they would not regard any 
		bureaucratic hurdles spoken of as a reason for delay or as preventing 
		them from acting, and that if there were a case for a national clinical 
		director for dementia, they would get on with it. I think that Professor 
		Mike Richards has proved a success as national clinical director for 
		cancer and that that system has proved a success. I urge the Treasury to 
		apply as much pressure as possible to the Department of Health to get 
		this matter moving along, because there does not seem to be any obvious 
		or easily explicable reason for further delay.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The next report that I want to examine is entitled &#8220;Helping people from 
		workless households into work&#8221;. I think there is agreement across the 
		political parties that something needs to be done in this area. Much 
		more needs to be done than has been done hitherto in terms of welfare 
		reform and helping the hard core of people who live in workless 
		families. They have not experienced people going out to work, because 
		they do not have that around them in their own households.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In recommendation 9, we say that the Department 
		for Work and Pensions could not tell us how many of the 2.9 million 
		people who had started a new deal programme were still participating in 
		it, nor what proportion of workless households chose not to work rather 
		than being out of work because of personal circumstances. That suggests 
		that there is still a lot to do. How can we assess objectively the 
		success of the new deal programme, which we would all like to do&#8212;there 
		is much party political banter about the new deal, but I would like a 
		reliable, objective assessment of its successes and failures&#8212;if the 
		Department cannot even tell us how many of the people who started a new 
		deal programme are still on it or what proportion choose not to work?</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The coal health compensation scheme was an extraordinary subject&#8212;I know 
		that the right hon. Member for Islwyn has a personal constituency 
		interest in it. The scheme provided compensation for miners afflicted by 
		various industrial diseases and was very worth while. What was 
		extraordinary about it was that the then Department for Trade and 
		Industry&#8212;now the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory 
		Reform&#8212;managed to make several solicitors multimillionaires. A small 
		firm in Doncaster called Beresfords had a senior partner, Mr. Beresford, 
		who had a personal salary of £16.7 million. I asked the permanent 
		under-secretary, Sir Brian Bender, about that:</p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Now under any view, 
		the purpose of this scheme wasn&#8217;t to make individual solicitors in 
		Doncaster multi-millionaires, was it?&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">He agreed that that was not the purpose of the scheme. Notwithstanding 
		the difficulties about people&#8217;s common-law rights, it was extraordinary 
		that a way could not have been found&#8212;statutorily if necessary&#8212;to get the 
		money that Parliament had voted for the purpose to the people who needed 
		it and to contain and control the risk of people such as Mr. Beresford 
		clawing it up for their own purposes. To me, that was unacceptable and 
		obscene&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Andrew 
		Mackinlay:</b> He&#8217;s good for a knighthood.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b> I hope not.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The next report I wish to consider is on the efficiency programme. We 
		have had much discussion about the extent to which efficiency savings 
		can be relied on and whether they are cashable or non-cashable. We 
		accept that there are technical difficulties in that area, but I hope 
		that the Minister will accept that we all have an interest in having 
		efficiency numbers that we can rely on so that we know that real 
		efficiency is delivered, not measures that cut into the bone of 
		Departments. Real efficiency will help to deliver better public services 
		while providing more taxpayers&#8217; money for other areas. That is 
		especially important in the light of the article in <i>The Guardian</i> 
		that I read the other day, which said that the Government are now 
		embarking on Gershon 2, a second round to identify savings in addition 
		to the £21.5 billion to which the hon. Member for Great Grimsby 
		referred.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I do not know what the second round will be called yet, although I 
		suggest that it should be called Eagle. Then when the efficiency savings 
		have been delivered, the Treasury can tell the Prime Minister that the 
		Eagle has landed.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Angela 
		Eagle:</b> I was seven years old when the eagle 
		landed before, and the hon. Gentleman may also remember that occasion.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b>
		I do remember that occasion, and it is time for a reprise. Harrison Ford 
		has made a comeback, so I do not see why the eagle should not do so.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Justine 
		Greening (Putney) (Con):</b>
		My alternative suggestion would be &#8220;Gershon and on&#8221;, because that is 
		what it will do.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Assets Recovery Agency has recovered only £23 million against 
		expenditure of £65 million. Most of us are at a loss to explain how £65 
		million can be spent to recover only £23 million by an agency that has 
		the law on its side. The only thing to do with the people who were 
		responsible for the agency&#8212;I think that they have now moved on&#8212;is plant 
		them in the institutions of this country&#8217;s enemies to find out whether 
		they can destroy the economic and financial viability of those countries 
		as well as they have managed the Assets Recovery Agency.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I turn to the delays in administering the 2005 single farm payment 
		scheme in England, which is a good example of my earlier point about the 
		unnecessary restrictions in the motion. On the Rural Payments Agency and 
		the single farm payment scheme, the permanent secretary to the 
		Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Helen Ghosh, told 
		our Committee:</p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Ministers were being 
		told it was possible when it was not in fact possible&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I am glad to have got that on the record, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but it was 
		out of order for me to do so, because that was said in a hearing that we 
		had with the permanent under-secretary to the same Department on the 
		same subject this January, and the report has not yet been published and 
		is not part of report HC 893, which comes within the motion. I hope that 
		that makes my point for me.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord):</b>
		Order. To some extent, it does, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman 
		for pointing out that he was out of order. He made some valuable points 
		earlier, but it is now important that he stay within our guidelines.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b> Not only will I do so, but I am nearly 
		finished. I have the reports with me to try to ensure that I stay 
		strictly on the rails.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Thames Gateway report was also interesting for the wider issues that 
		it raised. I quote very briefly from paragraph 13, where we said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The Department&#8217;s 
		overall management of the programme has been weak. It is yet to 
		establish arrangements for controlling the programme such as a budget, 
		implementation plan, joint risk management, appropriate financial 
		incentives, a performance management framework for delivery partners, 
		public reporting on progress, and measurable performance indicators.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Those are among the most basic things that we would expect anyone who 
		manages a large Department, agency or project to have taken on board 
		from the start, but to have managed to spend £670 million without doing 
		any of them takes some doing. I hope that the Treasury is not only on 
		the case, but involved in allied areas where similar management failings 
		may have arisen.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I want briefly to turn to the private finance initiative, because the 
		figures published in the appendix of our report on tendering and 
		benchmarking show that, when the whole stream of payments going forward 
		is added up, the total liability that now faces the public purse is £170 
		billion. Of course, the Treasury was anxious to point out&#8212;Mr. John 
		Kingman wrote to the Committee to make this clear&#8212;that, in doing so, one 
		is adding future and non-comparable figures to present figures without 
		applying any appropriate adjustment and that aggregating the stream of 
		future payments gives a net present value of £91 billion. In complaining 
		that he did not like giving us the £170 billion figure, Mr. Kingman 
		said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;It is rather as if we 
		were adding a figure in £ to one in $, without converting the 
		currencies, and ending up with one that is not denominated in any 
		currency at all. I am obviously uncomfortable providing the Committee 
		with a figure which is meaningless&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That takes the prize for being unnecessarily complicated and almost 
		guilty of sophistry, because £170 billion is a fairly easily 
		understandable number. It is fairly obviously true that £170 billion in 
		35 years&#8217; time will not be the same as £170 billion today&#8212;we can all 
		understand that&#8212;and that the two factors that must be taken into account 
		to get from one number to the other are time and interest rates; quite 
		where foreign currencies come into it I do not know. I can only assume 
		that Mr. Kingman, whom I know to be a very bright man, is guilty of 
		having a trait to which many bright civil servants sometimes fall prey: 
		an attraction to complexity. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby said that 
		the Rural Payments Agency chose the most complex scheme available, the 
		dynamic hybrid. Quite why it had to choose that scheme I do not know. 
		The Germans chose the dynamic hybrid, too, but they managed to make it 
		work. We did not.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I fear&#8212;this is probably a subject for a book&#8212;that one of the problems 
		facing our public sector, and affecting the way in which our senior 
		civil service conducts itself and advises Ministers, is that senior 
		civil servants are attracted to complexity like moths to a bright light. 
		We need a bit of simplicity. We need to concentrate on basics, including 
		having a budget for a project, making sure that there is an 
		implementation plan, and ensuring that the delivery partners know what 
		on earth the project is supposed to do. If we get back to that, we will 
		have a greater chance of ensuring decent taxpayer value for the 
		expenditure for which Parliament votes.</p>
