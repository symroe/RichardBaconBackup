		<b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk)</b> (Con): It is 
		a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett). 
		In his book on the Treasury, David Lipsey says that when watching a 
		hearing in the Public Accounts Committee, it is impossible to tell from 
		Members' questions which party they come from. When I read that, I 
		thought of the hon. Member for Hemsworth, because I listen with great 
		interest to his contributions and questions, and have on occasion 
		abandoned my planned line of questioning to take up where he left off.
		<p class="speechbody">I listened to the 
		hon. Gentleman's speech with great interest. He is right that problems 
		are involved in tending towards oligopoly in suppliers: that applies not 
		only to PFI contracts, but to bank finance. A financial journalist who 
		covers capital markets recently told me that he was worried about the 
		capacity of the financial markets to absorb the Government's huge 
		pipeline of social infrastructure projects. That means, of course, that 
		prices are likely to go up. There are legion examples of the City and 
		financial advisers running rings around the Government, perhaps the most 
		extraordinary being that of the Ministry of Defence building. The most 
		extraordinary aspect, which is not mentioned in our report, is that the 
		MOD went into the swaps market without a swaps adviser, and was of 
		course taken to the cleaners. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I agree with the hon. 
		Member for Hemsworth about the worries that should arise if there is 
		only one bidder for a contract. I, too, was struck by the fact that the 
		Libra project had only one bidder. That should automatically set alarm 
		bells ringing, as the National Audit Office told me a long time ago. 
		Three or four weeks ago, I had a meeting with the mobile phone company, 
		O2. It was a congenial meeting and they were a nice bunch of fellows. 
		They told me, with some pride, that the company was bidding for the 
		ambulance contract and that there was a good chance that it would get it—not least because 
		it was the only bidder. They were very pleased about that, but it nearly 
		turned my blood cold. I have not had the chance to raise that with the 
		National Audit Office, but I hope that it will take notice of this 
		debate. I say to the Economic Secretary that I would not suggest for one 
		minute that, assuming that it was done legally, the contract should be 
		removed from the company on the ground that it was the only bidder. 
		However, in such a situation it is incumbent on the Treasury, the Office 
		of Government Commerce and all the other players involved to take a 
		particular interest in the contract to ensure that it does not go wrong. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Like other Members, I 
		hugely enjoy being a member of the Committee. I pay tribute to Sir John 
		Bourn and his team at the National Audit Office. I pay particular 
		tribute to those in the press office, who are unfailingly helpful to me; 
		and to the Committee staff here. They are ably led by Nick Wright, who 
		is extremely good humoured when I send him e-mails at three o'clock in 
		the morning. The other day, I suggested that if he did not like that, I 
		could telephone him at three o'clock in the morning, but for some reason 
		he said that he would prefer to carry on receiving the e-mails. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I wish to refer to 
		several issues. I have served on the Committee for two and a half years 
		and, as we consider the various projects and reports, I sometimes tend 
		to feel that we are listening to a scratched record. The most startling 
		example of that was our hearing on tackling benefit fraud. The National 
		Audit Office report on the subject includes a chart, which refers to 
		previous studies. Indeed, it stated that our Committee examined the 
		matter in 1998. Under the heading &quot;On the scale and nature of Housing 
		Benefit fraud&quot;, our report stated: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">
		&quot;It is totally unacceptable that seven years after we last looked at 
		this issue&quot; - </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">that is in 1998, so the report is referring to 
		1991 -&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Housing Benefit fraud should exceed £900 
				million, and the Department still did not have information to 
				show whether fraud is increasing, or all the information they 
				need on the types of fraud, including landlord fraud, and 
				variations at regional and local level. The absence of reliable 
				information must cast doubt over the decisions the Department 
				have taken to invest in anti-fraud work and over the 
				achievements they have claimed.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">The helpful appendix 
		of the NAO's recent report, &quot;Tackling Benefit Fraud&quot; places previous 
		recommendations in the left-hand column and action taken by the 
		Department in the right-hand column. In most cases, something is written 
		in the right-hand column, but in the case that we are considering, it is 
		blank. In other words, we made a recommendation in 1998 and the 
		Department has done nothing about it. When we questioned Sir Richard 
		Mottram about whether housing benefit fraud was increasing or 
		decreasing, he could not tell us. He had an idea, but he could not tell 
		us the exact position five years after we said that it was 
		unacceptable—and that was seven years after we had previously considered 
		the matter. That is one of the essential worries about the work of our 
		Committee. However many good reports we publish, the Government do not 
		listen hard enough. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In the famous 
		agricultural fraud case involving Joseph Bowden, we had published a 
		previous report on the business of the then Ministry of Agriculture, 
		Fisheries and Food - now the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural 
		Affairs - and the permanent secretary had had to admit that he had 
		not read it. We had previously recommended that the Department could 
		learn lessons on dealing with agricultural fraud from the way in which 
		benefit administration fraud had been handled. The permanent secretary 
		was not even aware of the report, even though it related directly to his 
		responsibilities and was addressed effectively to his Department as well 
		as Parliament. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In paragraph 32 of 
		our 31st report, &quot;Tackling Benefit Fraud&quot;, we concluded that the </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Department were unable to assure us that 
				the number of people committing fraud, its overall value or the 
				level of landlord fraud were reducing, although they believed 
				this to be the case.&quot; </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">Paragraph 33 states:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The Department acknowledged that the pace 
				of change had been less than desirable.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">That is one way of 
		putting it. It continues: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Despite efforts over the years to drive 
				up performance, the results of their comprehensive performance 
				assessment review in autumn 2002 had been very mixed, and the 
				Department considered that the record of local government in 
				administering housing benefit was not defensible.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">That is an 
		interesting sentence because it is the point where our responsibilities 
		as a Committee end. I said to Sir Richard Mottram that if local 
		government's record in administering housing benefit was indefensible, 
		surely that was the point at which policy itself caused Government 
		expenditure to be uneconomic, ineffective and inefficient. There is no 
		way round that. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Sir Richard Mottram, 
		who is an able mandarin, simply smiled in a delphic manner and replied 
		that that was policy. I then tackled the Secretary of State for Work and 
		Pensions, whom I bumped into in the coffee queue in Portcullis House. 
		Although I would not describe his answer as delphic, it was difficult to 
		understand. However, it boiled down to the contention that, by the time 
		we shifted to a better system, the people whom we would need to make it 
		work would have left. We could not therefore make changes, even though 
		we recognised that the housing benefit fraud system, as administered by 
		local government, was indefensible. I find that a weak reply and I 
		should like a little more effort to be made. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">It is not obvious 
		that housing benefit must be administered by local government simply 
		because it relates to housing, which is based in local areas. I hope 
		that the Treasury is beginning to consider that, because too much money 
		is at stake and too many mistakes have been uncorrected for too long.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The second theme 
		that I want to mention is transparency. The Treasury will know that I 
		have always taken a great interest in professional fees, not least for 
		the Treasury building. I will not labour the point, as I made it in last 
		year's debate, about the £25.2 million for professional fees for the 
		Treasury building. I have a letter on my desk from the Financial 
		Secretary - so it must be true - saying that that is apparently very good 
		value compared with other projects. The reason I am slightly sceptical 
		is that when we ask witnesses about the level of fees, they are not 
		always completely candid. When we had as a witness the chief executive 
		of Bouygues UK, which is working on the Home Office building in Marsham street right now, I asked him 
		what the level of professional fees in relation to that building was. He 
		said that they were £9 million, and he repeated it two or three times. I 
		asked him two or three times whether £9 million was all. Finally, 
		through gritted teeth, he said in his French accent, &quot;No, £25 million.&quot; 
		I had to ask him three or four times to get the right answer out of him. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">When we had a 
		hearing on Wembley stadium, I was struck by an article in the <i>Evening 
		Standard</i> which said that professional fees in relation to Wembley 
		national stadium were £82 million. I therefore asked Ms Sue Street, the 
		permanent secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, 
		whether that article was accurate. Her reply was, </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;I am very sorry, I am advised that we do 
				not know.&quot; </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I asked her if she 
		would send us a note, and she kindly did so. The report has been 
		published extremely recently, so we have not yet debated it, but I refer 
		to it because it makes the general point about professional fees. When 
		it came out earlier this week, it elucidated the facts: professional 
		fees relating to Wembley stadium were indeed £81 million, which covers
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Fees, Fixtures, Fittings and Equipment&quot;,
				</p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">and - this is one I 
		like - &quot;inflation for delayed start&quot;, whatever that means; and there is no 
		breakdown so one cannot see how much of it is inflation for delayed 
		start. It also covers &quot;contingency&quot;, for which there is also no 
		breakdown, so one cannot see how much of it is contingency, and </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;other costs in the Multiplex construction 
				contract&quot;. </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That alone is £81 
		million. That is not the half of it, however - actually, it is slightly 
		more than half of it - because there is another line, </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Bank arrangement fees/finance costs&quot;, </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">which were a further 
		£22 million. Then there are </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Legal and other professional fees&quot;, </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">which were a further 
		£11 million, and perhaps the best line of all, &quot;WNSL&quot; - Wembley National 
		Stadium Ltd. - &quot;management fee&quot;, which is a further £19 million. That 
		makes a total of £133 million. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Hon. Members may 
		recall that the lottery grant to the football stadium at Wembley was 
		£120 million—all of that and more went on paying the professional fees. 
		That is why it is a subject that we need to keep under review and on 
		which the National Audit Office needs to keep an eye. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The reason I 
		referred to transparency is that I sometimes get the sense that we are 
		not given as much information as would be helpful to enable us to reach 
		considered judgments on these matters. One notable exception was the 
		report on the redevelopment of the Ministry of Defence main building. 
		Page 24, one of my favourite pages in any recent National Audit Office 
		report, sets out with startling clarity how the public sector comparator 
		is arrived at. Again, I referred to that in the debate last year, so I 
		will not dwell on it, but it simply sets out the base costs for each 
		item, the extra cost because of the risk, and, in the final column, the 
		risk as a percentage of the base costs. How it is worked out is 
		therefore transparently clear. It is obvious how easy it is to 
		manipulate the figures, to which we referred in our report when we 
		alluded to the fact that just by changing the risk factor for one item - capital 
		expenditure - from 29.5 per cent. down to 29 per cent., the public sector 
		comparator can be changed so that instead of it being £100,000 more 
		expensive it is £1 million cheaper. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Government now 
		say that they have a much more sophisticated method of analysing risk 
		factors and coming up with a sensible arrangement for advising 
		Departments on what sorts of risk factors ought to be applied to their 
		projects. In a recent hearing, when we were told by a witness that the 
		figure for the risk factor was 24 per cent. for capital expenditure, we 
		asked why. The reply came that that was the figure that the Treasury 
		gave. When we asked how the Treasury got that figure, we were told that 
		the Treasury had had a study done by Mott MacDonald, a group of 
		engineering consultants, and that that was the figure with which it came 
		up. Being a bit of anorak, I decided that it would probably be useful to 
		look at the Mott MacDonald report, which is precisely what I did. In 
		that study, the Treasury provided a list of some 60 projects, and Mott 
		MacDonald provided a further 20 projects, making a total of 80, and it 
		analysed them to see what the typical cost overruns had been. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">It is interesting to 
		study the Mott McDonald report in detail. The measurement of operating 
		expenditure is covered on page 10: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;There was great difficulty in obtaining 
				information on operating expenditure. Such information was only 
				available on a small number of projects.&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">It turns out: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Of the 80 projects initially reviewed, 
				only 50 projects had a reasonable amount of information, and 
				were retained for analysis. Although most of the information 
				required on the retained projects was available, some key data 
				was lacking.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">As a result of that 
		analysis, Mott McDonald comes up with an optimism bias, which involves 
		calculating a percentage figure to add to the total cost of a project so 
		as to arrive at the project's actual cost—basically, one begins with the 
		original cost estimate and adds in the optimism bias to calculate what a 
		project will really cost. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Mott McDonald 
		report contains a helpful chart that explains that for standard 
		buildings the optimism bias is 24 per cent.; for non-standard buildings 
		it is 51 per cent.; for non-standard civil engineering projects it is 66 
		per cent.; and hon. Members will be relieved to know that for standard 
		civil engineering projects it is only 44 per cent. Having examined the 
		chart, it occurred to me that the figures must derive from the 50 
		projects that Mott McDonald has studied. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">At the back of the 
		report, there is a project list containing standard buildings, 
		non-standard buildings, standard civil engineering projects and 
		non-standard civil engineering projects—for example, Manchester airport; 
		terminal 4 at Heathrow; Salisbury hospital, phase 1; the Limehouse Link 
		road; and the A34 Newbury bypass. I expected to see three columns to the 
		right of those projects. First, a column listing the original cost 
		estimate; secondly, a column listing the actual out-turn; and thirdly, a 
		column listing the percentage overrun. By aggregating the percentage 
		overruns, one could calculate an average cost overrun for standard 
		buildings, non-standard buildings, non-standard civil engineering 
		projects and so on. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">One could not 
		calculate the figures in the table without going through that exercise. 
		However, I have examined the report carefully, and it does not contain
		any figures, so it is a mystery how Mott McDonald 
		calculated the 24 per cent., 51 per cent. and 66 per cent. figures. Bear 
		in mind that the whole purpose of referring to the report is that the 
		Treasury advises Departments on percentage optimism bias as a direct 
		result of it. If one asks a Department why it has included a percentage 
		optimism bias, it will say, &quot;The Treasury told us to&quot;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Jon Trickett:</b> I am listening to the hon. 
		Gentleman's argument carefully. Does he agree that the Mott McDonald 
		report, which is a critical document on which the Government rest much 
		of their case about public sector comparators, measures deal creep 
		within the public sector but fails to take account of deal creep in the 
		private sector, which means that we end up comparing apples with pears?
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> The 
		hon. Gentleman anticipates my concluding point. I fear that this is 
		simply another way - if a rather more sophisticated way - to provide any 
		number that the Government require for the public sector comparator. 
		Given that the Treasury uses the report and that Departments say that it 
		gives them numbers based on it, it is strange that the report states 
		that </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;the study results on their own should not 
				be used directly as a benchmark to assess optimism bias levels 
				in current and future projects.&quot; </p>
				<p class="speechbody">The report states a number of reasons for that:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">
		&quot;the introduction of risk management, improved procurement practices 
		(based on greater diligence at the project definition stage), 
		partnering&quot; -&nbsp; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">that is always a good one -&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;more controlled cost monitoring, value 
				management, and the application of concurrent engineering.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">In other words, the basis for the numbers that are 
		now being used is itself flawed, but the Treasury still recommends it to 
		Departments. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I turn to the conclusion of the Mott MacDonald 
		report, which states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The optimism bias recorded for projects 
				in several recent studies have proved that there is a tendency 
				for project managers and project owners to underestimate costs 
				and time, and overestimate benefits for a project. </p>
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">Failure to consider and actively manage the causes of optimism 
				bias tends to result in an accumulation of unforeseen cost and 
				time overruns, and benefit shortfalls. However, by developing 
				strategies for the effective management of project risk areas, 
				it is possible to reduce the optimism bias and raise confidence 
				levels in project estimates.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">This exercise, which was undertaken on the 
		Treasury's behalf, is in fact a laudable one. Getting some form of 
		scientific measure of what goes on inside large projects, why they go 
		wrong and the precise extent to which they go wrong is very helpful. But 
		I come back to my point about transparency. At the moment, there is no 
		transparency. One cannot go through the report and discover how the 
		figures have been arrived at, so the suspicion remains that the whole 
		exercise is still just another way of manipulating the data, just as the 
		public sector comparator itself too often seems to be a way of 
		manipulating the data, in order to demonstrate the required result. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I turn briefly to the future. As I said at the 
		beginning of my remarks, I worry that our reports and the legion 
		warnings issued about projects in many different areas of government—particularly, but not only, computer 
		projects—are so often ignored. <a name="npfit2"></a>The national health service provides us 
		with an example of huge procurement: the National Programme for 
		Information Technology in the NHS in England. The NPfIT concerns the 
		provision for clinicians of electronic patient records, and it is 
		costing a fortune. Estimates have varied. A recent announcement valued 
		contracts in the region of £2.3 billion. That figure rose to £2.6 
		billion, and following the recent letting of quite a few contracts, it 
		has reached some £4.2 billion. Indeed, it is expected to rise still 
		higher. The problem is that however much money is spent on the 
		programme, it will not work unless there is buy-in from the users. One 
		of the classic problems with such projects is that the users are not 
		consulted adequately or in time. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The magazine <i>Computer Weekly</i> and the NPfIT 
		itself jointly undertook a study of this issue. A health care market 
		research firm called Medix undertook a survey of people in the health 
		service who might need to have contact with the programme. It asked, 
		&quot;What consultation has there been with you personally about the NPfIT?&quot; 
		One per cent. described such consultation as &quot;More than adequate&quot;; 3 per 
		cent. said it was &quot;Adequate&quot;; 8 per cent. said it was &quot;Barely adequate&quot;; 
		and 11 per cent. said it was &quot;Inadequate&quot;. However, 75 per cent. said of 
		such consultation that there had been &quot;None at all&quot;, and 2 per cent. 
		were &quot;Unsure&quot;. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The NPfIT was so furious about these results that 
		it issued its own press release, in which it completely ignored any of 
		the survey's negative findings. Those who want to check the survey can 
		do so easily, as it has helpfully been made available on the internet. 
		That is one of the few ways in which IT manages to hoist itself by its 
		own petard. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Slightly worryingly, the striking report by the 
		National Audit Office—we are not really debating it; indeed, it was 
		published only today, and we have yet to take evidence on it—says in 
		large letters on page 7: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">
		&quot;Lessons applying more widely from the Bureau's experience are&quot; -&nbsp; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">it is referring to the Criminal Records Bureau -
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The importance of consulting with 
				potential users of the service at the earliest opportunity to 
				gain a clear understanding of how they are most likely to access 
				the service, and responding promptly and effectively to such 
				feedback.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">In the report on the Libra project, to which other 
		Members have referred, we offer the following warning on page 4: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Departments will not achieve the full 
				benefits of introducing IT if they do not redesign business 
				processes in parallel.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">The NPfIT says that it will begin redesigning the 
		business processes, but it has already let the contracts. The warnings 
		that we are giving are current. We have not even had the chance to 
		consider the NAO report, listen to the evidence and issue our own 
		report. However, the advice is clear: consult early. In respect of the 
		second report, we already know that the NPfIT is ignoring the need to 
		design business processes in parallel while introducing IT. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">That brings me to my final point, about the Office 
		of Government Commerce. The NAO's report on the Criminal Records Bureau 
		states, in paragraph 13 on page 3, </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The Office of Government Commerce Gateway 
				Review Team raised questions about the readiness of the Bureau 
				to go live, but accepted that there was 'no turning back'.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">That raises the question of whether the gateway 
		reviewers are culturally too close to the people whom they are 
		reviewing. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Work and Pensions Committee is currently 
		conducting a study on the IT projects under way in the Department for 
		Work and Pensions. I hope that we shall also look at that, and that the 
		Treasury will take account of it. One of the witnesses for the study was 
		Sir Peter Gershon, chief executive of the OGC. He was asked whether he 
		had ever stopped a project, and also whether he had ever advised that a 
		project was too complex. In each case he gave answers that were long, 
		difficult to understand and non-committal, which suggests that the real 
		answer was &quot;No&quot;. I hope that the OGC will seriously consider publishing 
		gateway reviews; perhaps the Treasury will give it a nudge in that 
		direction. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Allan:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman 
		about the effectiveness of the gateway review process. I have looked 
		into it myself, and my impression is that the process has no power to 
		stop projects. If a red light is thrown up, it is for the Department or 
		the public body to decide whether to proceed. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> That is true. What is also true is 
		what I thought the hon. Gentleman was going to say: the gateway process 
		does not apply to the health service or the NPfIT. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The central point is this. If these matters were 
		in the public domain and MPs, members of the public and journalists 
		could read about them, the Department might be helped to conclude that 
		it should take a slightly more robust view, and perhaps occasionally 
		stop projects in their tracks. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I think the OGC does a great job, and that it 
		negotiated a fine deal with Microsoft. Sir Peter Gershon's recently 
		conferred knighthood is well deserved. If the title &quot;Hero of the 
		Taxpayer&quot; existed, he would be worthy of it, because he does a 
		tremendous job—but he does it in very difficult circumstances. His only 
		real power is one of suasion. He cannot point at Departments and tell 
		them what to do. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Leigh: </b>Sir Peter is retiring after three 
		years as a permanent secretary. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I am disappointed to hear that, 
		because I think he was just getting into his stride. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">One of the central aspects of the problems we face 
		is the fact that the civil service is constantly on the move. Permanent 
		officials actually move far more often than Ministers. I had the 
		opportunity to have a chat with the right hon. Member for Livingston 
		(Mr. Cook) the other day. I gave him a lift in my car. I was picking up 
		my laundry from the launderette, as you do, and there he was walking 
		along. As his office is in Norman Shaw South, I decided to give him a 
		lift. He said that when he was Leader of the House one of the most 
		extraordinary things he discovered from talking to parliamentary counsel 
		was that when drafting Bills parliamentary counsel almost never get to 
		talk to the same civil servant twice about the same subject, because 
		civil servants move on so quickly. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I was delighted to hear that Sir Andrew Turnbull 
		is thinking of introducing four-year posts for civil servants. That will 
		be a very interesting development, if it actually happens. I was also 
		delighted to hear from Sir David Omand, when the Chairman and I went to 
		Heathrow airport to visit Customs and Excise, that the Government's 
		approach to risk management will in future be tied not just to the 
		statements of internal control that permanent secretaries must sign, but 
		to the spending review process. If they can get traction on that, it 
		will be very interesting. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Another point made by David Lipsey in his book was 
		that the Treasury and the PAC ought to be allies. I sometimes feel that 
		we are not nearly as close allies as we should be, and I believe that 
		one of the reasons is the fact that the information that would enable us 
		to work more closely together is held too closely. The Whitehall culture 
		is the same in other Departments as it is in the Treasury: &quot;Your job is 
		to defend your Department against outsiders&quot;. From the Treasury's point 
		of view, Parliament is just another outsider. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">As the NAO has pointed out, we are about to spend 
		an extra £61,000 million of taxpayers' money over the next three years 
		in the spending round. A 1 per cent. improvement would lead to an extra 
		£14 billion going into front-line services. I have considerable 
		scepticism about whether that will happen, but if we are to see the 
		changes that we want and achieve the fundamental shift in the way that 
		the Government deliver services to the public, which Sir Peter Gershon 
		spoke about in his ongoing efficiency review, we need to use every lever 
		at our disposal. I believe that the most important lever is 
		transparency, and oxygen, to enable the people of this country to govern 
		themselves, to criticise their Governments more effectively and to 
		ensure that taxpayers get value for money.<br>
