&nbsp;</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		<b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk):</b> Illegal imports were 
		discussed at length during the passage of the Animal Health Bill. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. 
		Brown) mentioned the amendments tabled by Labour Members. A striking 
		aspect of the Second Reading debate was that Labour, Liberal Democrat 
		and Conservative Members and those from the smaller parties all said 
		that more must be done about illegal imports. One of the most memorable 
		speeches in that debate was a veteran rant by the hon. Member for West 
		Ham (Mr. Banks). 
		<p class="speechbody">There is evidence 
		that the Government have been complacent about the matter. The Curry 
		report and that of Devon county council flagged up the issue of illegal 
		imports. I quoted on Report what the Minister said on Second Reading:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;DEFRA has been leading interdepartmental 
				discussions.&quot;—[<i>Official Report</i>, 12 November 2001; Vol. 
				374, c. 666.] </p>
					<p class="speechbody">I do not know 
		whether it is a coincidence that the column number is also the sign of 
		the beast. I quoted that comment again just over a month later on 13 
		December. It did not seem that much had happened, certainly considering the Minister's answers. It 
		is now 27 February, nearly four months later, and I have received a 
		letter from the National Farmers Union, for which I am grateful, that 
		says that it welcomes </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;the Government's announcement that it 
				will convene a high level forum on this issue, probably taking 
				place next month.&quot; </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">Thank God for that. 
		We have gone from interdepartmental discussions to a putative high-level 
		forum. Presumably, if the NFU had known when the high-level forum was 
		going to take place, it would not have used the word &quot;probably&quot;. In 
		other words, the Government had not even set a date, although if they 
		have now, I would be grateful if the Minister told us today. The 
		Government do not seem to be taking the issue seriously enough. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I have a letter, 
		which was copied to me, from a constituent, Mr. Rod Tuck, of Diss in 
		Norfolk to the Speaker of the House of Commons. In it he complains about 
		the Minister. The letter says: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Having read in Hansard details of the 
				parliamentary debate on the Animal Health Bill on 
				Thursday 13th December, 2001, I would like to register an 
				official complaint against Elliot Morley MP, who seriously 
				misled the House as detailed on Page 1025 at 1.45pm when 
				answering a question from Mrs Winterton. With reference to the 
				UK import controls on meat/meat products compared to those of 
				Australia and America he states there is no significant 
				difference between theirs and our custom controls on meat/meat 
				products.&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">For the benefit of 
		the Chamber, I have the exact quotation. The Minister said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;On the claims that are being made about 
				measures taken in America and Australia, I have been to those 
				countries comparatively recently and I must say that I have not 
				noticed any particular differences from the checks and security 
				in our country.&quot; [<i>Official Report</i>, 13 December 2001; Vol. 
				376, c. 1025.] </p>
		</font>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Tuck kindly sent 
		me a copy of his correspondence with the US Department of the Treasury 
		Customs Services, which contains a helpful list of the differences 
		between the approaches of the UK and of Australia and the United States, 
		but I will not try the Chamber's patience by listing them all. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Tuck also 
		enclosed an e-mail that he had received from Mr. Jim Dewhirst, who had 
		recently been to Australia. Mr. Dewhirst wrote: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The details of the precautions that the 
				Australians and New Zealanders take are as follows:- </p>
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;1) You receive a warning about 20 minutes before the plane 
				lands that it is illegal to take into the country any product of
				animal or plant 
				origin. If you are in doubt about anything that you are carrying 
				you should declare it on arrival. You are warned that 
				contravention of the rules will automatically lead to a hefty 
				fine, or worse. </p>
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;2) On the flight you are given 'visitor cards' to complete. One 
				of the questions asked is:- 'Have you been on a farm in the last 
				48 hrs?' Another is:- 'Do you possess any spiked shoes?' We had 
				golf shoes with us, so we had to declare them. </p>
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;3) When we arrived at the terminal building all our hand 
				luggage had to go through X-Ray machines.&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody" >This is in on 
		arrival, not departure. </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;They were looking for any illegal 
				products, including food products and drugs. </p>
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;4) After the X-Ray machines we were then confronted by sniffer 
				dogs. These were more in evidence in New Zealand than in 
				Australia. We were even selected out of the crowd to help test a 
				trainee dog: some contraband was hidden on our luggage trolley 
				about 30 metres before we passed the dog. The dog did not fail 
				to apprehend me!&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody"><b>The Parliamentary 
		Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. 
		Elliot Morley) :</b> This is all very interesting, and I should say that 
		I was in Canada two weeks ago and the procedures were no different from 
		those at Heathrow. The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that a 
		recent report in the <i>Scientific and Technical Review</i> of the OIE, 
		which is in the public domain, calculates that illegal meat imports into 
		the USA each year vary between 450,000 kg and 4 million kg. That is not 
		a criticism of the USA; it just demonstrates that people should not 
		think other parts of the world have a panacea. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The hon. Gentleman 
		should also remember that when we had an outbreak of foot and mouth, 
		other countries rightly introduced procedures because of the risk. My 
		final point is that New Zealand has 3.5 million visitors a year, while 
		Britain has 48 million. There is the issue of managing these things at 
		airports. </p>
		<b>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon</b>: I am grateful, and indeed honoured, that I 
		managed to provoke the Minister into intervening so early in the debate. 
		I accept that there is no panacea; no Opposition Member believes that 
		there is. The problems are plainly serious. The United States is a much 
		larger country than ours with huge land borders and five times our 
		population. I would be interested to hear comparative tonnages if the 
		Minister has the figures. The Minister referred to New Zealand and the 
		United States, but I was talking about Australia. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I should like to 
		finish dealing with Mr. Dewhirst's fifth point. He states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;When we arrived at Passport Control we 
				were again given the third degree about illegal 
				imports, particularly so when we arrived in Australia. It was at 
		this stage that we handed over the cards that we had completed . . . Our 
		golf shoes were taken away and disinfected, being returned in sealed 
		plastic bags. When we arrived in Australia from New Zealand we had with 
		us some sea shells and some enormous pine cones that Kate&quot; - </p>
			</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Dewhirst's wife -
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;had collected. After inspection of these 
				we were told that we could keep most of the shells but 
				definitely not the pine cones. It's rather ironic that if we had 
				not gone to Australia, but returned straight home to the UK, we 
				would have had no problems whatsoever keeping the pine cones, in 
				fact we would not have even needed to declare them. If I'd had a 
				mind to do it, I could no doubt have waltzed through Customs 
				with half a dead alligator in my luggage, without anyone even 
				bothering to challenge me.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Dewhirst may be 
		exaggerating, but such checks on arrival, X-ray checks, sniffer dogs, 
		taking items away in plastic bags and disinfecting them, do take place. 
		The story shows how seriously the problem is taken there. Such measures 
		would illustrate to people going through the system the Government's 
		perception that travellers should take the matter more seriously. As the 
		hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) said, it is a question not just of 
		doing things behind closed doors with curtains drawn, but of getting the 
		message across to people that it is a serious issue. The Government say 
		that they have put up posters and are trying to do more. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Last Friday I 
		returned to the United Kingdom after a long-haul transatlantic flight. I 
		landed at a Royal Air Force base at which no checks of any sort took 
		place. Signs on the plane reminded armed forces personnel about the 
		dangers of criminal activity with drugs, but no mention was made of
		animal imports. When we landed at the airport, I saw no posters, no customs 
		officers and no checks. I could indeed have waltzed through with half a 
		dead alligator. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bill Wiggin 
		(Leominster):</b> I have written to the Minister about a leaflet that I 
		picked up in Detroit airport, which asked me if I had visited the UK and 
		been on a farm. It specified the UK, which doubtless does untold damage 
		to our tourist industry. On my return to the UK, I went through the 
		airport and searched high and low for any signs asking me whether I was 
		bringing meat into the country. I found one, but I would not have done 
		so had I not been pushing a pram, because it was next to the lift; 
		disabled people may also have seen it. </p>
		<b>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon</b>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. As for writing 
		to the Minister, I wish him luck. Many of us know that the chances of 
		receiving a reply of any sort from DEFRA within three or four months are 
		extremely slim. I recently wrote to a DEFRA official in Bristol in the 
		hope that he might be able to help my constituent. I explained in the 
		letter that there was no point in writing to Ministers. I had explained 
		to my constituent beforehand that that was what I intended to do because 
		I knew that at least two months would pass before I received an apology 
		for not receiving a reply. I certainly wish my hon. Friend the Member 
		for Leominster (Mr. Wiggin) luck. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">My hon. Friend makes 
		a good point—the problem is not being flagged up openly enough. As a 
		letter from the National Farmers Union makes clear: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The admission that no further resources 
		have been allocated to scrutinising personal imports at Heathrow 
		airport since February last year underlines the need for no more 
		delay in a firm grip being taken of this vital issue.&quot; </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Customs and Excise 
		collects £102,000 million in various duties. Its primary function is 
		obviously collecting revenue, not necessarily deciding how that revenue 
		is spent. It is important to recognise that the resources are there if 
		the political will is there too. There is increasing consensus across 
		all parties about the need to do something about this matter. The 
		political will should be there to take a firm grip on this issue.<br>
