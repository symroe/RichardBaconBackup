		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> I 
		am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate. I have followed 
		the national programme for IT in the health service for several years, 
		principally because of my membership of the Public Accounts Committee 
		and that Committee&#8217;s interest in value for money, delivery, 
		effectiveness, efficiency and economy. Of course, IT projects are 
		notorious, across Governments of different political persuasions, for 
		failure to deliver. The national programme for IT in the health service 
		is the largest civilian IT project in the world. For that reason alone, 
		I have been following its progress with great interest.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I am not a specialist in health matters or in IT, 
		but I am greatly interested in value for money. The hon. Member for 
		South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), who is a former member of the PAC, will 
		confirm that serving on that Committee makes one put on spectacles that 
		are primarily non-party-political, because one is considering value for 
		money. That is what we do. I say in parenthesis that I agreed with the 
		hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about private sector IT contractors. Of course, 
		things go wrong with such contractors and they are better at hiding it. 
		I hold no brief for any national or local IT contractors or any specific 
		supplier.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">It is extraordinary and regrettable that the 
		important national programme for IT has become party political. I can 
		think of nothing less party political than a computer system. There are 
		legitimate matters for political debate&#8212;perhaps fewer than existed 30 
		years ago, but many remain, including housing and&#8212;dare I mention 
		it?&#8212;schooling. However, computer systems are not among them. There are 
		computer systems that work and computer systems that do not work. We 
		should all want the former&#8212;and that should be it.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Serious technical problems remain with the system, 
		which needs to be put back on track. However, the Department of Health&#8217;s 
		current proposal for the local ownership programme is not the right way 
		to do it. The right answer involves more choice for trusts and more 
		competition between suppliers to get the confidence and business of the 
		trusts. One gets ownership through choice and successful delivery 
		through ownership.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Where needed, the Government should review the 
		operational performance of the local service providers against their 
		original contractual obligations and examine how they have accounted 
		financially for their actions. I believe that forensic accountants would 
		reveal some interesting facts about millions of pounds of losses being 
		hidden. I also want to comment briefly on the Computer Sciences 
		Corporation and iSOFT; we learned this morning that CSC is considering a 
		bid for iSOFT.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">It is indisputable that the programme is not 
		working properly technically. I was surprised to note in the 
		presentation made to the Prime Minister on 19 February the sentence:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The key challenges 
		and risks to delivery are now not about technology to support the NPfIT 
		but about attitudes and behaviours which need to be the focus of senior 
		management and ministerial attention as we move forward&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Of course, getting the right attitudes and 
		behaviours to support the programme&#8212;and, indeed, any IT programme&#8212;are 
		central. That is why experts say that many problems are not about IT but 
		getting human beings, especially well-paid, intelligent and 
		independent-minded human beings, to operate in the right way. Of course, 
		change management must happen, but the idea that no serious technical 
		problem remains is nonsense. The fact that the Prime Minister is being 
		told that there is no serious technical problem is worrying, because it 
		suggests that Ministers have not always been told all the facts that 
		they need to know.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">One need look no further than the visit that took place on 14 May by 
		David Nicholson, chief executive of the NHS, and Richard Granger, 
		director general of IT, to Milton Keynes to examine the problems there. 
		One IT contact of mine charitably described the visit as a catastrophe. 
		It followed a letter, to which the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman 
		Lamb) referred, from 79 doctors, nurses and secretaries at Milton Keynes 
		general hospital, which said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;We are doctors, nurses 
		and secretaries at Milton Keynes General Hospital. From our early 
		experience of the new Care Records Service computer system it is not fit 
		for purpose.</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">In spite of heroic 
		efforts from our IT staff and from the installing company, start-up 
		glitches have been unacceptable and particularly bad in outpatient 
		clinics. More seriously the software is so clunky, awkward and 
		unaccommodating that we cannot foresee the system working adequately in 
		a clinical context.</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">In our opinion it 
		should not be installed in any further hospitals.</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">If it is not already 
		too late there is a strong argument for withdrawing the Care Records 
		Service system from this hospital.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Milton Keynes is in the southern cluster, where Fujitsu is installing 
		the product from Cerner Millennium. The staff say that it does not work, 
		is not fit for purpose and should be withdrawn.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Let us consider the position of the other 
		clusters&#8212;the north-east, eastern, north-west and west midlands&#8212;where CSC, 
		following of the withdrawal of Accenture, has control of three clusters 
		and is installing iSOFT Lorenzo. The only problem is that iSOFT&#8217;s 
		Lorenzo product has not yet been written. It is therefore nonsensical to 
		claim that there are no technical problems. It is worrying that the 
		Prime Minister has been told otherwise.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">When David Nicholson and Richard Granger visited Milton Keynes, they 
		acknowledged the scale of the problems. Yesterday they were cited in <i>
		E-Health Insider</i>, which stated that a spokesman had said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Mr. Granger and Mr. 
		Nicholson gave the Trust their full support resolving issues related to 
		CRS. The Trust is committed to working with CfH to improve CRS&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">However, big problems remain.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I now turn to iSOFT&#8212;and I note that the hon. Member for 
		Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly), who has done much work in this 
		area, is now in his place. The funny thing is that page 6 of the iSOFT 
		Group plc&#8217;s 2005 annual report and accounts says:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Available from early 
		2004 LORENZO was the first solution on the market targeted to meet the 
		demanding requirements of healthcare providers around the world.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I stress, &#8220;available from early 2004&#8221;. Yet when CSC and Accenture, which 
		was still involved at that point, wrote a review of Lorenzo in February 
		2006&#8212;some considerable time after the statement about its 
		availability&#8212;they concluded:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;There is no mapping of 
		features to release, nor detailed plans. In other words, there is no 
		well-defined scope and therefore no believable plan for releases beyond 
		Lorenzo GP.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Lorenzo GP is a basic version for GPs. The review continues:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;There is a significant 
		risk that an evaluation of the &#8216;gap&#8217; between the needs of CfH and the 
		capability of the generic solution will require significant re-work of 
		product and platform layers. This will likely lead to schedule slippage. 
		Additionally, there is a risk that the generic solution will contain 
		features that are not required by CfH, lengthening the time taken to 
		deliver the CfH solution.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">When iSOFT&#8217;s financial results were published&#8212;rather late&#8212;it said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;We intend to begin 
		delivering LORENZO functionality to users within the NPfIT before the 
		end of 2007, and for individual solution modules to become available on 
		a phased basis through 2008.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">How can a firm begin to deliver functionality to users in the NPfIT 
		before the end of 2007, and individual solution modules on a phased 
		basis through 2008, for something that its 2005 annual report claimed 
		was already available in 2004? Perhaps that is why it has been under 
		investigation by the Financial Services Authority. It appears that in 
		the past it has been making statements to the stock market that are not 
		justified by the facts. Those statements probably caused the share price 
		to be higher than it otherwise would have been. Many directors 
		subsequently sold their shares. However, that is a matter for the 
		Department of Trade and Industry, and probably outside the scope of the 
		debate.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Stephen O'Brien:</b>
		My hon. Friend&#8217;s expertise is invaluable. In evaluating the risks to the 
		programme&#8217;s progress, we want to be constructive about the Government&#8217;s 
		difficulties. What is valuable in iSOFT at the moment if there is no 
		developed product? Is it simply that it happens to have the Government 
		contract?</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b> That is a good question. The company has a 
		range of other products. Many experts would say that some of them, 
		especially some GP systems, work well. However, what people would be 
		paying for if they bought iSOFT is a moot point. It is especially 
		worrying that CSC announced this morning that it might consider a bid 
		for iSOFT. The idea of having a vertically integrated model under which 
		the local service provider actually owns its main software subcontractor 
		is very worrying at a time when the Government, the Department of Health 
		and the NHS are only just beginning to acknowledge the need for more 
		choice locally.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In that environment, if CSC actually owns iSOFT and the area is 
		controlled by CSC, it is hard to see how, if that bid went through, 
		other suppliers of competitive products for mental health and other 
		aspects, such as primary care, would get a look-in. It was an odd 
		reflection on customer relations when iSOFT sought last week to improve 
		its relationship with CSC, which must be one of its biggest customers, 
		by saying that it was probably going to take legal action against it. 
		That is not what one normally thinks of as a way of improving relations 
		with one&#8217;s biggest customer. The company seems to have come to its 
		senses yesterday, saying that it was probably going to suspend the legal 
		action for the time being.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Paul 
		Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab):</b> The hon. 
		Gentleman rightly saw me rummaging through my notes on iSOFT, whose 
		affairs I have followed since July 2004, with my old investigative 
		journalist&#8217;s hat on. I note that the hon. Gentleman is not criticising 
		the Government for putting investment into IT, but is making some good 
		points about the way in which they are doing it, which I believe the 
		Government should listen to. Clearly, it is not the Government&#8217;s fault 
		that iSOFT is a thoroughly dodgy company, but does the hon. Gentleman 
		agree that it would instil more confidence in the programme and the 
		regulatory environment if the City authorities speeded up their 
		investigation into iSOFT&#8212;and, indeed, if the DTI also took up the case?</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b> I very much agree with that, as these 
		investigations take far too long. The hon. Gentleman referred to his 
		previous role as an investigative journalist, and I commend him for the 
		work that he has done. I also commend the excellent work of Simon Bowers 
		on the financial pages of <i>The Guardian. </i>Yes, the DTI should get 
		involved and the current investigation by the Financial Services 
		Authority should be speeded up. No, it is not the Government&#8217;s fault if 
		iSOFT is a dodgy company, but it may be their fault if, not having 
		exercised sufficient and due diligence, they continue to make advance 
		payments through the local service provider and in effect prop up a 
		dodgy company that has failed to deliver, has made false statements 
		about the availability of its products to the stock market, and has 
		misled investors, the public and the NHS.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The way forward&#8212;clearly, there must be one&#8212;proposed by David Nicholson, 
		the chief executive, is to put greater emphasis on the local side 
		through the local ownership programme. It sounds good in theory, but I 
		fear that what it means is something different. I quote a piece from <i>
		E-Health Insider</i> of 25 May, which pointed out that the chief 
		executive said that the aim of the local ownership programme was</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;&#8216;to reinvigorate the 
		programme.&#8217; This includes &#8216;giving the SHAs, with their trusts and PCTs, 
		greater participation in the choice of NPfIT products and in the 
		planning and timing of deployments.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That sounds fine, but does it mean that if people do not want to, they 
		will not have to install Cerner Millennium? No. Does it mean that if 
		they do not want to, they will not have to install iSOFT&#8217;s Lorenzo&#8212;apart 
		from the fact that it has not been written yet? No, it does not, so they 
		do not really have choice. What I fear this is all about is not real 
		localisation, but the decentralisation of blame. It is about handing 
		over to others the responsibility for implementing the unimplementable, 
		and then being in a position later to blame them when they cannot do it. 
		I thus have my doubts about the national local ownership programme. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Stewart Jackson:</b>
		Does my hon. Friend agree that if iSOFT is unsuccessful in refinancing 
		its business in November, it will be the fourth IT company to bail out 
		of this particular IT programme?</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b> It probably will, which is one of the reasons 
		why I suspect that CSC has been sniffing around with iSOFT&#8217;s banks. By 
		the way, iSOFT was not aware of this until after it had happened, but 
		CSC&#8212;the local service provider for three fifths of the programme&#8212;has 
		been talking to its main software subcontractor&#8217;s banks about buying 
		iSOFT&#8217;s debt, presumably because that would put it in pole position for 
		a bid, should it wish to make one. I believe that it is incumbent on the 
		Government to state their view of local service providers owning a main 
		software subcontractor and the potential impact on competition and 
		choice, which are essential if we are to get out of this mess. Greater 
		choice, I believe, is essential.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">If the notes to the Prime Minister may not have been completely accurate 
		in saying that technology was not a problem, it remains true&#8212;as I 
		mentioned earlier, and I saw the hon. Member for South Derbyshire 
		nodding in agreement&#8212;that a lot of the problem is about human behaviour, 
		changing attitudes and so forth. In order to do that, we have to have 
		ownership. The question is how we get ownership, and the answer is 
		through choice, and by making local trusts accountable for choosing what 
		they want, and then accountable for delivering it. That, rather than 
		having systems foisted on them that they do not want and will not use, 
		is what is needed. We must have more choice.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Some hon. Members have referred to the Public Accounts Committee report, 
		which I had some hand in. I want to draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to two 
		particular paragraphs: one a recommendation, the other a rather worrying 
		conclusion, which the Government should reflect on far more than they 
		have so far. The first is recommendation 4 on page 5 of the report, 
		which says:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;In view of the 
		slippage in the deployment of local systems, the Department should also 
		commission an urgent independent review of the performance of Local 
		Service Providers against their contractual obligations.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">My belief is that such a review of the performance 
		of LSPs against their contractual obligations would strengthen the 
		Government&#8217;s arm in the negotiations that would be necessary if the 
		value of the contracts were reduced. Look at what has been going on with 
		British Telecom in London, for example. BT employed the software firm 
		IDX for a considerable period, and my best estimate is that about £200 
		million was spent before it sacked the firm and moved over to the Cerner 
		product. The effect is akin to owning a Ford transit van, getting rid of 
		it, then buying a Mercedes van, but still trying to do the maintenance 
		with the old Ford transit manual; it does not work.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The money is completely wasted, yet neither BT in London nor CSC in its 
		areas&#8212;not to mention Fujitsu in the south&#8212;has done anything to try to 
		account for the losses that must have been made. At least Accenture had 
		the honesty to come up front and say that it was making provision for 
		$450 million. I am certain that the other local service providers are 
		hiding millions of pounds&#8212;probably hundreds of millions&#8212;of losses. The 
		Government ought to be aware of that now, because it has consequences 
		for the behaviour of the LSPs in trying to claw back money because they 
		did not make any on the contracts.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Finally, I want to say a quick word about CSC and iSOFT. I have already 
		mentioned them in passing and in response to interventions. We cannot 
		overstate the importance of the fact that three fifths of the national 
		programme for IT in the health service depends on this relationship 
		between CSC and iSOFT, so it is of considerable interest that the 
		president of European business development, the president of the 
		northern region of the UK and the Netherlands, the senior vice-president 
		of global infrastructure services for Europe, the middle east and 
		Africa, the vice-president of service delivery for Europe, the middle 
		east and Africa, the service delivery director of the NHS for the 
		original contract in the north-west region, the vice-president for new 
		NHS accounts, the chief operating officer for Europe, the middle east 
		and Africa, the vice-president for service delivery to BAE Systems, the 
		president for CSC southern region, and the director of services for 
		global accounts have all resigned quite recently. I therefore wonder in 
		what fit state this company is, in terms of its senior management, to 
		continue to be a local service provider, let alone to bid for one of the 
		main software subcontractors.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">It is interesting to note that CSC in Europe, the middle east and Africa 
		has recently announced a continuation of the two-year freeze on all 
		training. What does that mean for the NHS? Contrary to what the Minister 
		said earlier, I do not think that Opposition Members have any interest 
		in protecting local service providers or IT suppliers. We want to see 
		competition and choice and we want to things working. It is not obvious 
		to me from the available evidence that CSC is in a particularly healthy 
		position.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b> 
		Might it not be the case that the company will become heavily dependent 
		on the expertise provided by local hospitals rather than use its 
		own&#8212;with costs to local hospitals?</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b> Insofar as I have understood the hon. 
		Gentleman&#8217;s question&#8212;it is important to have expertise locally in 
		hospitals. As the hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned, one of the 
		great problems has been a whole incubus of a central layer trying to 
		impose what happens locally from a great distance. Plainly, one size 
		does not fit all.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I shall now conclude, as other Members wish to speak. I hope that the 
		Government will acknowledge that the criticisms of the programme are not 
		made in a party political spirit, at least not by me. I would like to 
		see the programme work. If it is to work, however, serious problems need 
		to be overcome.</p>
