		<div class="asublist" style="margin-bottom:3pt"><cite>This speech was 
			given in the House of Commons on 24 February 2009 as part of the 
			debate on British agriculture and food labelling.
</cite></div>
		<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon 
		(South Norfolk) (Con): </b>Last November, the Minister, who is 
		unfortunately not in her place, presented the David Black memorial award 
		at the British Pig Executive breakfast on the Terrace, where some hon. 
		Members were present. It went to Ian Campbell for his distinguished 
		service to the pig industry.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:justify">In 
			November 2006, the award was presented to my constituent, Philip 
			Richardson, a distinguished farmer, who has made a big contribution 
			to the pig industry over many years&#8212;some hon. Members know about 
			that contribution. A few months ago, I was shocked to hear on 
			&#8220;Farming Today&#8221; at 5.45 am the sound of Mr. Richardson&#8217;s voice as he 
			declared that he was leaving the pig sector.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left">My 
			constituent&#8217;s farm had 350 breeding sows. Some hon. Members know 
			that a breeding sow produces, on average, a couple of litters a year 
			of 10 progeny each. The 350 breeding sows therefore produced some 
			7,000 progeny a year. That puts into perspective the problems that 
			pig farmers face when they lose £20 per animal. That does not sound 
			like an enormous amount of money to lose, but when it is multiplied 
			by the number of piglets produced, it suddenly becomes a six-figure 
			sum. I was shocked to hear my constituent&#8217;s comments because he was 
			one of the first farmers I met when I became Member of Parliament 
			for South Norfolk and he has made an enormous contribution to the 
			industry, as recognised by the award that the Minister&#8217;s 
			predecessor, Lord Rooker, presented to him only two years ago.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">That is 
			only one indication of what has happened in the industry in the past 
			10 years, during which we have not had the protection&#8212;perhaps 
			&#8220;protection&#8221; is the wrong word and I should say that we have not 
			given consumers the information that compulsory country of origin 
			labelling would provide. I believe that such labelling would have 
			resulted in a greater market share for British producers. The 
			Minister said that the use of the Union flag is known to be a 
			successful marketing device.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">I was 
			pleased that, at the Oxford farming conference in January, the 
			Secretary of State said:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" align="left" style="margin-left:20pt;">
			&#8220;Under current European regulations, a product&#8217;s country of origin 
			is the place where it underwent its last significant process. But 
			this can hide where it really came from.&nbsp; A pork pie made in 
			Britain from Danish pork can legitimately be labelled as a British 
			pork pie. That&#8217;s a nonsense, and it needs to change.&#8221;</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left">That 
			sounded remarkably familiar. Indeed, it could have been lifted from 
			a speech that my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) 
			made many years ago when he introduced a private Member&#8217;s Bill on 
			the subject. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar 
			(Mr. Pickles), I tried to introduce a Bill&#8212;most recently, last 
			October and before that, in 2004&#8212;along the same lines. I welcome the 
			fact that the Government are now on the same page in recognising 
			that labelling is important and that it contributes to better 
			consumer information. However, I cannot understand their reluctance 
			to take on&#8212;or at least argue the case with&#8212;the Commission more 
			forcefully than they have done.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left">It is 
			important to nail one thing clearly. It is logically impossible to 
			suppose that providing greater transparency to consumers in a given 
			market could, in itself, favour one product over another. It would 
			not do that; what it would do is improve the operation of the 
			market. Personally, I hope that that market improvement would occur 
			through more consumers, knowing the accurate origins of the food, 
			choosing to buy British-produced food. I make no bones about that; 
			indeed, it is one of the reasons why I would like clearer food 
			labelling.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left">However, 
			clearer food labelling might not have that result. There might be 
			people who wish to buy Italian salami or French bread. In the days 
			of apartheid, people avoided, for perhaps good reasons, buying South 
			African apples or oranges, which were clearly labelled. They avoided 
			buying them because they wanted to express a consumer choice, and 
			they were entitled to do that. Just after the Berlin wall came down, 
			there were people&#8212;I was one of them&#8212;who sought out eastern European 
			gherkins to try to support our brothers and sisters in Poland. 
			Having rather let them down in the second world war and left them 
			behind the iron curtain for 50 years, we needed to do what we could 
			to support their growing markets. I made a conscious decision to 
			seek out Polish products in the early &#8217;90s. The point is that 
			consumers ought to have a choice.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left">The 
			Government&#8217;s voluntary approach has not succeeded and it is not 
			going to succeed. I was talking to a DEFRA official recently who 
			seemed to wallow in his powerlessness. He said, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s occupied 
			ground, there&#8217;s nothing we can do.&#8221; I say to the Minister&#8212;she is not 
			in her place now, but I hope that she reads this debate 
			afterwards&#8212;that if she cannot get the right advice, she needs to get 
			new advice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury said, it is 
			notoriously true&#8212;of both lawyers and economists&#8212;that if someone 
			cannot get the advice that they want, they should find a new lawyer. 
			That is what the Government did over the Iraq war, so why can they 
			not do it over food labelling? They should find the right advice, 
			get in the lead and push hard in the European Commission.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left">There is 
			now much more support for such moves in Europe than there was. I was 
			over in Brussels with the chairman of the British Pig Executive just 
			last June, meeting a German Christian Democrat MEP who was 
			interested in exactly that issue and who was pushing for compulsory 
			labelling of country of origin in the European Parliament. Things 
			have moved on, but the Government need to push much harder than they 
			are currently prepared to.</p>
