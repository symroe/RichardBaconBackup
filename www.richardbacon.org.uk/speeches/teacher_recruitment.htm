			<p class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in the chamber of 
			the House of Commons as part of the debate on Teacher Recruitment, 
			on 16 April 2002</cite></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk): 
			</b>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this debate, 
			especially as I made three or four applications before I was 
			successful. My reason for initiating it relates specifically to a 
			constituent, Mr. Christopher Read, who teaches at the Hewett high 
			school in Norwich, the largest school in Norfolk, which has 1,800 
			pupils and about 115 full-time equivalent teaching staff. It was not 
			until I had been successful in my application for a debate and 
			started to talk to colleagues about the subject that I became aware 
			of how widespread the problem faced by my constituent is. I shall 
			start with the particulars of his case, and then move on to discuss 
			the more general themes that it illustrates.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr. Christopher 
			Read, who lives in my constituency and works in the city of Norwich, 
			is a qualified electronic design engineer. He worked for some 30 
			years for a local engineering firm, and has an impressive curriculum 
			vitae. For example, he designed electronic control systems for 
			Trident nuclear submarines. He also designed the electronic vane 
			control systems for the Heysham and Torness nuclear power stations, 
			as well as working on projects for clients such as the Ministry of 
			Defence, the Royal Air Force, British Aerospace, British Steel, 
			British Coal, BP, ICI and the former Government Department, the 
			Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr. Read was made 
			redundant from his engineering firm some time ago and decided that 
			before the end of his career, he would like finally to do what he 
			had always wanted to do at some point&#8212;go into teaching. We have all 
			seen the advertisements that the Government have sprayed liberally 
			over every medium known to man, including newspapers and cinema, 
			asking people to go into the teaching profession. He responded to 
			that call and, having a background in physics, he was particularly 
			suited to help meet the shortage of teachers in maths and science 
			subjects. The only problem was that because he had an HND, not a 
			degree, he could not be taken on as a fully qualified teacher, but 
			would have to work within the school environment towards fully 
			qualified teacher status. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">An additional 
			problem was that because Mr. Read took his HND in 1968, it is not 
			regarded by the Open university, with which he would need to study 
			to gain the required number of points to obtain full teacher status, 
			as attracting the same number of points as a more recent HND. 
			Apparently, that is because before 1971 the HND was not modular&#8212;one 
			had to learn everything and sit the exam at the end of the course&#8212;so 
			it is said that there is no sensible way of comparing the old and 
			the new HND. I may not be alone in thinking that that may be a point 
			in favour of the old HND, and that it required more intellectual 
			accomplishment than the new modular HND. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Indeed, in a 
			widely quoted book, &quot;Class War: The State of British Education&quot;, 
			Chris Woodhead mentions the subject of modularity on pages 14 and 
			15. He says: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;The move to 'modularity' is a second, highly significant 
			development. Nowadays many, if not most, GCE and A-level syllabuses 
			are divided up into modules, or units, of work. The candidate is 
			tested on each module once it has been completed.&nbsp; Headteachers 
			worry about the impact this has on teaching and learning and 
			extra-curricular activities. Most feel that the introduction of the 
			AS examination has reduced the sixth form to a treadmill that allows 
			no time for anything other than preparation for the next wretched 
			assessment. Many worry that a student who is unhappy with the grade 
			he has achieved in a particular module can take the assessment again 
			in the hope of achieving a better mark. Mr. Timms needs to tell us 
			whether he thinks this new facility has made public examinations 
			more or less intellectually challenging&quot;. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The Department 
			told me last Thursday that Mr. Timms, the Minister for School 
			Standards, would reply to this debate, but as he cannot be with us, 
			I hope that the Minister for Young People and Learning, who is here 
			in his stead, will answer my question. I am sure that young people 
			are delighted that he represents them. [Interruption.] Indeed, do 
			they know that he does? Can he tell us whether the introduction of 
			modularity is an advance in creating an intellectual challenge? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">My constituent is 
			being discriminated against for the simple reason that he took a 
			course and completed an HND before the introduction of modularity. 
			In his case that has a particular effect, as he is 55 now&#8212;he was 54 
			when he began teaching. As a result of his HND not being valued as 
			it should be and as a more recent HND would be, it will take him 
			three to four years, rather than the 12 to 18 months that it would 
			otherwise take him, to gain an honours degree equivalent and then 
			the additional qualified teacher status&#8212;which would take him only 
			two or three months, because of his extra experience. Mr. Read will 
			be 58 or 59 by the time he achieves qualified teacher status. In the 
			interim, not only will he be paid less than a fully qualified 
			teacher&#8212;although I imagine that his greater experience allows him to 
			impart more to physics students than some younger teachers can&#8212;but 
			his job will not be secure because his &quot;instructor&quot; status means 
			that he does not have a permanent contract. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The statutory 
			instrument that deals with the matter is the Education (Teachers' 
			Qualifications and Health Standards) (England) Regulations 1999. 
			Paragraph 3 is about 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;Instructors with special qualifications or experience&quot;. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">I should have 
			thought that being trusted by the nation to design electronic 
			components and control systems for Trident nuclear submarines 
			qualified Mr. Read under that heading. The paragraph says: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;This paragraph shall apply in the case of an unqualified teacher 
			appointed, or proposed to be appointed, to give instruction in any 
			art or skill or in any subject or group of subjects . . . the 
			teaching of which requires special qualifications or experience if, 
			at the time of his appointment . . . the local education authority . 
			. . are satisfied as to his qualifications or, as the case may be, 
			experience; and . . . no suitable qualified teacher, graduate 
			teacher or registered teacher is available for appointment . . . 
			Such a teacher may be employed at a school to give such instruction 
			as aforesaid, subject to paragraph (3), for such period as no 
			suitable qualified teacher, graduate teacher or registered teacher 
			is available for appointment or to give the instruction.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The effect of that 
			is that the school is not empowered to give him a permanent 
			full-time contract as a teacher, and was recently obliged to 
			advertise his post. Mr. Read had to apply for his own job, despite 
			being trusted by the school and the head teacher and providing a 
			valuable service to the students. Five people applied for the job in 
			addition to Mr. Read, one of whom was interviewed. Mr. Read was also 
			interviewed and, I am pleased to say, was successful in being 
			awarded his own job. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Hon. Members may 
			find that laughable, and it is rather extraordinary. The Government 
			have a stated commitment to encourage more people to go into the 
			teaching profession. Indeed, when one opens the broadsheet 
			newspapers or goes to the cinema one cannot fail to see their 
			advertisements, which show glowing pictures of people saying how 
			much they owe to their teachers, and ask whether those in the 
			audience have ever thought of going into teaching. In the light of 
			all that, we should consider the ludicrous situation in which Mr. 
			Read and others find themselves. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr. Read's head 
			teacher at the Hewett school, Mr. Christopher Wade, says that there 
			is much hype about the graduate teacher programme, through which a 
			graduate without a teaching qualification can train on the job. He 
			says, however, that in fact it is hype about nothing, because it is 
			virtually impossible to obtain the required funding, unless it is 
			for English or maths, and also in an education action zone. There 
			are only 235 fully funded places across the country. He goes on to 
			say: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;You can do it if the school funds it itself&quot;</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">&#8212; and that his 
			school is doing that with two of its teachers&#8212; 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;But if there were teachers out there we wouldn't be doing it. We 
			are not primarily a training establishment.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">None the less, 
			many schools have been turned into training establishments, paying 
			out of their own budgets to train the teachers they need.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">As a result of 
			securing this debate and talking to colleagues about it, I became 
			aware that the problem was not confined to my constituency. A 
			colleague mentioned a case to me&#8212;I have not had an opportunity to 
			speak to the individual involved, so I will not identify him. The 
			case concerned a 49-year-old retired police officer who wanted to be 
			a teacher, preferably in a junior school. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The local 
			education authority concerned sent a letter to all parents asking 
			for help from people wishing to enter the profession. The man duly 
			contacted them in the hope that he would be able to join the 
			registered training scheme for those who do not have a degree but 
			have attained a good educational standard. He was informed that the 
			RTS exists in name only&#8212;no school in the LEA concerned has taken on 
			a teacher under the scheme because it is too expensive. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The Government 
			have the system in place to solve the teaching shortage, at least in 
			part, but they are unwilling to finance it. They must either pay up 
			or shut up. As an aside, the individual concerned said:
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;From what I've seen the possession of a degree doesn't necessarily 
			make a good teacher&#8212;some experience of life would be more useful to 
			those that have only gone from school to university and then back to 
			school again.&quot;
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">One cannot help 
			thinking that a 49-year-old police officer would have a lot to 
			contribute to a classroom, especially as the first requirement in 
			any classroom is the maintenance of discipline, without which there 
			is no possibility of learning.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Another hon. 
			Member mentioned to me another constituent, to whom I have spoken. 
			This lady does not wish to be identified in case it should hinder 
			her future prospects of employment. She is a qualified teacher with 
			17 years of classroom experience. It is my understanding, based on 
			what she said at Education&nbsp; Question Time, that the Secretary 
			of State, too, had 17 years' teaching experience when she took her 
			career break to go into politics. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The lady whom I 
			have mentioned took a career break to have a family, then, in answer 
			to the nation's call for more teachers, applied and was told that 
			she had to have recent classroom experience. She pointed out that 
			she was a fully qualified teacher with many years of experience but, 
			as she says: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;I seem to be in an impossible situation. I am disqualified from 
			even applying for the work that I would like to do, because my 
			qualifications and experience are unacceptable, yet I cannot fulfil 
			their requirements for registration without having worked.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">There are many 
			other examples. I shall quote that of Mr. Stuart Ballantyne, the 
			head teacher of Diss high school, in my constituency. Diss high 
			school is one of the best comprehensive schools in the country. It 
			has been named twice by the chief inspector of schools in his annual 
			report as one of the top 60 schools in the country. Mr. Ballantyne 
			received an expression of interest from a police officer with years 
			of experience and a master's degree in biology. I am pleased to say 
			that that person is teaching at the school. However, he had to be 
			given an enormous amount of reassurance by the headteacher because 
			of the temporary nature of the contract under which Mr. Ballantyne 
			was forced to employ him. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr. Ballantyne 
			nearly lost the services of this individual on a number of occasions 
			because he was so fed up with the runaround that he was getting from 
			the Teacher Training Agency. According to Mr. Ballantyne, the forms 
			that he has to fill in for teachers seeking qualified status are 26 
			pages long, and even after he has gone to the trouble of completing 
			them, officials from the Teacher Training Agency telephone him and 
			ask for information that has already been provided. He says that the 
			service is neither impressive nor slick, and is not what one would 
			expect. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr. Wade, at the 
			Hewett school in Norwich, told me that coping with teacher job 
			applications more or less required the attention of a full-time 
			senior member of staff&#8212;someone who should, of course, be preparing 
			and teaching classes. Mr. Ballantyne told me about a female modern 
			languages graduate who had been working at a school in a clerical 
			capacity for seven years. She had thought for some time about 
			becoming a teacher because of her gift with modern languages and her 
			degree. With the school's encouragement, she applied for the 
			requisite programme, but the Teacher Training Agency turned her down 
			flat, with no adequate explanation, despite the fact that the school 
			had come to know her well over several years and wanted to take her 
			on. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The Government 
			talk about autonomy and about trusting schools and professionals. 
			Paragraph 1.6 of the White Paper &quot;Schools&#8212;achieving success&quot; lists 
			the secondary education reforms that the Government are dedicated to 
			achieving. They include:
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;Giving successful schools the freedom they need to excel and 
			innovate.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Paragraph 5.17 
			makes a similar point: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;Where schools are successful, well-led and have a record of school 
			improvement, we want to free them from those conditions and 
			regulatory requirements which they tell us stand in the way of yet 
			higher standards and further innovation.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The Secretary of 
			State makes the point again in a pamphlet published by the Social 
			Market Foundation called &quot;Professionalism and Trust&#8212;the future of 
			teachers and teaching&quot;. When I first came across the Social Market 
			Foundation, it was run by a friend of mine, who was a good 
			Conservative, but things have moved on, and it now publishes 
			pamphlets by Labour Cabinet Ministers. In the foreword, the 
			Secretary of State says that the pamphlet 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;signals a new era of trust in our professionals on the part of 
			Government.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">She goes on to 
			say: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;Recruitment and most especially retention remain a real concern.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">I was prompted to 
			take an interest in this issue partly by a front-page article in The 
			Guardian on 28 August 2001, which appeared under the headline 
			&quot;Teacher shortage worst ever&quot;. I then read the chief inspector's 
			report when it was published on 5 February 2002, and it alluded to 
			serious problems in the recruitment and retention of teachers. The 
			single biggest problem is not recruitment but retention. Many people 
			want to go into teaching. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">I have read the 
			recent study published by the Centre for Education and Employment 
			Research, and I am grateful to the National Union of Teachers for 
			supplying it. This study, entitled, &quot;Teachers Leaving&quot;, whose 
			authors are Smithers and Robinson, says that teachers go into the 
			profession overwhelmingly because of the prospect of &quot;intrinsic 
			satisfactions&quot;. It states: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;The most important reason, accounting for about a third of all 
			responses, was 'working with children/young people'. This was 
			particularly the case for primary teachers who gave this as a 
			reason. About half the secondary teachers did so. Some teachers 
			expanded the point as 'the pleasure of seeing children learn', 
			'wanting to do something useful', or 'wanting to make a 
			difference'.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">In other words, 
			people enter the profession with a strong sense of vocation. Love of 
			the subject&#8212;the desire to convey knowledge and the excitement and 
			pleasure of teaching the subject to young people&#8212;came second. Yet 
			people do not stay. The study noted: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;About 12 per cent. of those admitted to PGCE courses, or reaching 
			the final year of BEd courses, do not successfully complete. But 
			this pales beside an inexplicable post-training wastage of over 30 
			per cent. Of every 100 final year students, 40 do not make it to the 
			classroom. With the initial teacher training budget currently 
			standing at £245 million this represents an annual loss of £100 
			million.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">I have spoken to 
			the National Audit Office about that shockingly huge figure. Like 
			me, my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) is a member 
			of the Public Accounts Committee, and I am sure that he will be as 
			interested as I am in understanding how the Government can spend so 
			much money on training teachers who do not stay in the profession. 
			That raises the question of why teachers are not staying in the 
			profession once they have entered it. The Smithers and Robinson 
			study identifies that among secondary teachers the most frequently 
			given reasons for leaving were work load, 57.8 per cent., pupil 
			behaviour, 45.1 per cent. and Government initiatives, 37.2 per cent. 
			It is interesting that salary is not mentioned in the first three. 
			It is included in the survey&#8212;it is fourth, with 24 per cent.&#8212;but it 
			is clear that money is not the main motivating issue. Issues such as 
			work load, pupil behaviour and Government initiatives are far more 
			important. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">I am again 
			grateful to the NUT, which supplied with me a copy of a study by the 
			Warwick institute of education, which quotes a teacher who said: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;I have the right to work without being abused&#8212;in industry it 
			wouldn't be accepted, yet day after day it's now just 'part of the 
			job'&quot;. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">I was recently 
			sent a poster by the Norfolk Mental Healthcare NHS trust. It is 
			running a campaign called &quot;NHS zero tolerance&quot;, saying: &quot;Staff 
			working in the NHS do so to care for others. They do not go to work 
			to be victims of violence or threatening behaviour.&quot; Where are the 
			Government schemes for the education system, highlighting the fact 
			that teachers go to work to teach, not to be the victims of violent 
			or threatening behaviour? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr. John 
			Randall (Uxbridge): 
			</b>My hon. Friend may be interested to know that when I tried to 
			ascertain the figures for teachers who have been assaulted either 
			inside or outside the classroom, I was told that those figures are 
			not collected. What does he think about that? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> 
			It shocks me. It seems to me that there is no possibility of doing 
			something about a problem unless one measures its scale. On the 
			other hand, if I were speaking for the Government, which fortunately 
			I am not, I would probably say that the numbers are so scary that it 
			is best not to collect them, because they might frighten the horses, 
			and even fewer people would be encouraged to go into the teaching. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The recruitment 
			and retention of teachers is a serious problem, and I have 
			identified pupil behaviour as the single biggest problem. The 
			current state of discipline in schools is a direct result of the 
			policy, which the Government promoted for several years, of having 
			targets for exclusions. It meant that fewer difficult children were 
			excluded from schools, and as a result discipline problems 
			increased. I am pleased to say that the Government have recognised 
			that that policy was flawed and have reversed it. Until they take 
			the question of discipline in schools seriously and make it clear to 
			teachers that they are backing them, rather than pupils who are 
			violent or disruptive, there is no serious hope of improvement. That 
			is a sine qua non for an improved situation. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Secondly, the 
			amount of bureaucracy, paperwork and Government initiatives must be 
			reduced. The Government say that such paperwork is necessary. At a 
			recent Education Question Time, I think I heard the Secretary of 
			State say that less paper was not the answer. That shocked me, and I 
			have also heard my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) 
			quote a similar line from her in a recent speech. I am sure that my 
			ears were not deceiving me. If the Government do not believe that 
			the answer must include reducing the amount of paper and trusting 
			teachers more, they have a long way to go before they have any 
			chance of restoring the education system. If there were ever a time 
			to be creative in appointing teachers, it is now. From what I have 
			seen, and according to the teachers to whom I have talked, the 
			Government do not seem to take that problem seriously enough. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">There is one 
			further issue that I feel that I must mention: spending. Yesterday I 
			was flicking through last Friday's Hansard, and more or less by 
			chance came across a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for 
			Ashford to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills about 
			whether she would 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;list the (a) title, (b) subject and (c) associated funding of each 
			(i) project, (ii) scheme, (iii) initiative and (iv) policy announced 
			by the Department for Education and Employment since 1997&quot;. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The Minister for 
			Young People and Learning, who is here today, took it upon himself 
			to answer the question for the Secretary of State. His answer was: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;Information is not held in the format requested&quot;&#8212; 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">that will not 
			surprise my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)&#8212; 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;and generating it would incur disproportionate cost.&quot;&#8212;[Official 
			Report, 10 April 2002; Vol. 383, c. 160W.] 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">It did not seem to 
			me to be that odd to ask about the costs of each project, scheme, 
			initiative and policy run by the Government. Without an accurate 
			record of what is being spent and what it is being spent on, it does 
			not seem very likely that education can be successfully managed. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">I have been 
			flicking through the appropriations accounts for the Department for 
			1999&#8211;2000, the most recent figures available, and some of the detail 
			will assist my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford a little, although 
			perhaps not quite as much as he would like. On page 8, under the 
			headings &quot;Class 1, Vote 1&quot; and &quot;Central government's own 
			expenditure&quot;, an item is given as: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;Ensuring that all young people reach 16 with the skills, attitudes 
			and personal qualities that will give them a secure foundation for 
			lifelong learning, work and citizenship in a rapidly changing 
			world&quot;. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The cost of that 
			is given as £83.625 million. However, from the second column, one 
			can see that the Government actually spent only £64.336 million on 
			it. On the next page, the item of expenditure given involves: 

			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; margin-left:20pt">
			&quot;Developing in everyone a commitment to lifelong learning, so as to 
			enhance their lives, improve their employability in a changing 
			labour market and create the skills that our economy and employers 
			need&quot;. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">That was to have 
			cost £340 million, but the Government spent only £312.967 million. 
			And so it goes on. Mr. Syms, my hon. Friend the Member for Poole, 
			asked about the total underspend in the Department for Education and 
			Skills. Those figures might be one reason why the total underspend 
			in education spending overall, both capital and current, for the 
			most recent available year, 2000&#8211;01, was £1,454 billion. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">There is 
			degenerating discipline in schools and pupil behaviour is cited as 
			one of the single most important reasons for teachers leaving the 
			profession, because of the Government's flawed policy on exclusions. 
			The Government continue to bombard teachers with paperwork, despite 
			huge evidence that they want to be left to get on with the job and 
			be trusted to do so&#8212;one only has to go round one's constituency and 
			talk to teachers, as I have, to find that out. Experienced people 
			coming in from the outside&#8212;such as people who have designed 
			electronic control systems for nuclear submarines or who have worked 
			for 20 years as police officers, dealing with more dangerous 
			behaviour than one would ever hope to find in a classroom&#8212;are 
			stymied at every turn before they are allowed to get on with the 
			business. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr. Phil Willis 
			(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I apologise for not intervening on 
			the hon. Gentleman earlier when he was talking about Mr. Read and 
			the Hewett school in Norfolk, but as he has returned to that subject 
			again in winding up his speech, will he say what the Conservative 
			party's policy is for solving the problem that he has rightly 
			identified? It is a very real problem, but what is the solution? Is 
			it to allow anyone to join the teaching profession simply because 
			they have good skills and abilities? Would that qualify David 
			Beckham, for example, to become a PE teacher? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr. Bacon : I 
			certainly hope that someone who is probably one of the most valuable 
			footballers in the world would be qualified to be a PE 
			teacher&#8212;subject to his foot being healed, for which we are all, of 
			course, praying. I would have thought that any school where he were 
			a PE teacher, in either the maintained or the independent sector, 
			would have substantially higher applications as a result. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">To answer the hon. 
			Gentleman's more serious and general point, plainly one does not 
			want to take simply anyone off the street&#8212;but the danger is that we 
			have almost been in that position. Another facet of the issue is 
			that so many higher education institutions are now keen to get 
			Government funding that they are offering education degrees in the 
			hope of attracting students who might not have made it on to any 
			other degree course. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">In a recent 
			conversation that I had with a head teacher in my constituency, I 
			asked where he was getting his teacher applications from. He said 
			that he was lucky if he got a decent number to select from, and that 
			when candidates come through the door, he, like other heads in a 
			similar position, is more or less obliged to insist on watching them 
			teach a lesson. That is because it is no longer possible to 
			establish on the basis of the recommendation and reference that 
			comes from the institution attended&#8212;in many cases, an institution of 
			which one has not heard&#8212;that someone has undertaken a reputable 
			teacher training programme and can be relied on, either as a 
			teaching practice candidate or as a full-time employee. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">The situation has 
			got much worse. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. 
			Willis) is right to say that it requires much thought. Taking people 
			from industry and other backgrounds, such as the police service, is 
			not the only answer. However, that is almost certainly part of the 
			answer. People with much experience of life have a lot to impart. My 
			personal view is that people should not seek to become teachers, 
			even if they have a vocation for it, until they are in their late 
			20s. I worked as a teacher for seven months, which I did not do 
			until I was 29. I worked in East Berlin, teaching East German 
			factory workers just after the Berlin wall came down. I am sure that 
			I was better at doing that in my late 20s than I would have been at 
			21, just out of university. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Part of the answer 
			is finding people from other backgrounds, but we should also ensure 
			that people who have a vocation for teaching and obtain a teacher 
			training qualification actually then choose to go into teaching, 
			because they see it as an attractive profession rather than one from 
			which they are scared off because they are likely to be attacked, 
			abused or have low professional status. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">Teaching is one of 
			the most important professions in this country. It should be one of 
			the first careers that bright graduates from the best universities 
			should consider. That is not the case at the moment. The 
			Government's present policies mean that it is not likely to be the 
			case, either, and it is about time they woke up to the seriousness 
			of the situation and started to do something about it.
