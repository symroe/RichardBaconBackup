		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000124">Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</a></b> 
		It is a great pleasure to take part in the debate and to follow the hon. 
		Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry). I, too, greatly 
		enjoyed the visit to Harvard Business School and would commend it to 
		anyone. I hope that before long the Government also go there and listen 
		to the professors.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. 
		Leigh) referred to my role in the exposure of the foreign national 
		prisoners scandal. I do not propose to say anything about that in this 
		debate, but merely to make one comment about the former Home Secretary, 
		the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke). I consciously and 
		deliberately did not call for his resignation over that matter, and I 
		was sorry to see him go. Some may say that his departure became 
		inevitable, but I continue to have a high regard for him and I think 
		that what has happened in the Home Office since then demonstrates that 
		the problems go much deeper than the issue of one Cabinet Minister. I 
		pay tribute to the right hon. Gentleman for the work that he did during 
		his time at the Home Office. &#8220;Oops, sorry, I did not mean to destroy 
		your Cabinet career&#8221; is not necessarily the most welcome thing to hear 
		from a parliamentary opponent, and that was not my intention. I can only 
		repeat that I have a high regard for the right hon. Gentleman, and I 
		hope that he will continue to make a contribution in this place.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Nevertheless, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend 
		the Member for Gainsborough, there is a serious problem with the Home 
		Office that goes well beyond one issue connected with the immigration 
		and nationality directorate. My hon. Friend said that the Home Office 
		had been unable to present a set of audited accounts to Parliament. 
		There have been the most serious problems possible with the Home Office 
		accounts. They were flagged up in a memorandum from the National Audit 
		Office to the audit committee of the Home Office, entitled &#8220;Home Office 
		Resource Accounts 2004-05 Audit Update from the National Audit Office&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I pay tribute to Mr. Darren Box, financial audit 
		director at the National Audit Office, whose persistence caused the 
		seriousness of the problems to come to light. His memorandum to the 
		audit committee states</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;At this stage we are contemplating a 
			disclaimer opinion on the accounts on the grounds that fundamental 
			control failures mean that we are unable to form a opinion on 
			whether the accounts are true and fair and whether expenditure 
			recorded in them is regular.&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">The memo continues:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;The accounts display a very limited 
			understanding of how different figures within financial statements 
			relate to one another indicating skills and experience deficits 
			within Accounts Branch. The accounts showed little evidence of 
			meaningful management review at any level.</p>
			<p class="speechquote">With the notable exception of IND, there is 
			no evidence of the accounts production process being subject to any 
			proper project management disciplines.</p>
			<p class="speechquote">Issues raised in our previous management 
			letters have not been actioned and appear not to have been 
			disseminated to relevant staff&#8221;.</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">Later, under the heading &#8220;Control Weaknesses&#8221;, the 
		memo states:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;In addition to late and poor quality 
			financial statements, serious control weaknesses have also been 
			identified during the audit. The weaknesses include:</p>
			<p class="speechquote">IT Controls: There is a lack of security 
			within key IT applications through the absence of unique 
			identification for system administrators, no audit trails, 
			weaknesses in control over standing data&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">and so forth.&nbsp; The memo adds:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;Bank reconciliations are the most 
			fundamental of all accounting controls as they enable payment, 
			receipts and cash balances to be validated to an external source and 
			provide assurance about debtor and creditor balances. Due to 
			difficulties in implementing the Adelphi accounting system, the Home 
			Office has been unable to reconcile its cash at bank position&#8221;.</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">That bears repetition&#8212;the Home Office has been 
		unable to reconcile its cash at bank position.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Bank reconciliations are fundamental. They are an 
		essential control over cash to ensure that income and payments recorded 
		in any organisation&#8217;s bank account match its accounting records. 
		Matching also provides assurance about debtor and creditor balances&#8212;in 
		other words, amounts owed to and by a Department&#8212;and can help to prevent 
		and detect fraud and error. <br>
		<NOTUS-DATE textMonth="July" 
year="2006" month="7" day="18"></NOTUS-DATE><br>
		What was worse was that the Home Office had not even realised that 
		failure to reconcile cash fully could ultimately undermine its ability 
		to provide Parliament with fully audited accounts.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The memo goes into further detail about the 
		Adelphi accounting system, stating:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;A further cause for concern has arisen from 
			our review of Adelphi transaction data. It took six months for the 
			Home Office to supply us with transaction data that we were able to 
			reconcile successfully to the Adelphi general ledger. However, when 
			the gross transaction value of debits and credits within this data 
			was totalled, they each amounted to some £26,527,108,436,994, almost 
			2,000 times higher than the Home Office&#8217;s gross expenditure for 
			2004-05 and approximately one and a half times higher than the 
			estimated GP of the entire planet. This suggests that something has 
			gone seriously awry...We have yet to receive an explanation for what 
			has happened... Collectively, these control weaknesses expose the 
			Home Office to a high risk of fraud, irregularity, poor value for 
			money and waste in its financial operations.&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000125">David Taylor:</a></b> Given that the Home Office 
		is feeling its way through this incoherent and inaccurate maze of 
		figures that underpin its performance and direction, can the hon. 
		Gentleman suggest why it is so certain that savings that are available 
		under contestability and outsourcing are sufficient to apply those two 
		techniques on a grand scale to the National Offender Management Service?</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000126">Mr. Bacon:</a></b> I do not think that I can. 
		Many of the so-called savings to be found under various aspects of 
		Government efficiency programmes&#8212;had we been in office, they would 
		probably have been found under the James committee savings&#8212;are very 
		questionable. A different example, with which the Financial Secretary 
		will be only too familiar, is that Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs is 
		busy sacking fraud staff, who were bringing in many hundreds of times 
		their own salary in some cases, in order to meet rather spurious 
		targets. However, I will not dwell on that.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The result of all that activity was that the 
		Comptroller and Auditor General, Sir John Bourn, was unable to reach an 
		opinion on the truth and fairness of the Home Office accounts for 
		2004-05, so he disclaimed an audit opinion. It is worth explaining what 
		disclaiming means. A disclaimer is not the same as a qualified opinion. 
		We are familiar with the idea of qualified opinions&#8212;for example, because 
		of concerns about fraud and error, there has been a qualified opinion on 
		the Department for Work and Pensions&#8217; accounts since 1988, which 
		specifies the particular aspects, such as housing benefit fraud, income 
		support fraud or whatever, that are the subject of concern. The same 
		happens with the European Court of Auditors in respect of EU accounts. 
		However, that is not what I am talking about. This is Sir John Bourn, an 
		Officer of the House, telling Parliament that he has no information at 
		all with which to form a view. The accounts were presented to Parliament 
		unaudited.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Irrespective of whether we are talking about a 
		public or a private sector organisation, that is an almost unbelievable 
		state of affairs. It is hard to imagine any private sector 
		organisation&#8212;whether it be a golf club or a multinational 
		corporation&#8212;for which that would fail to lead to enormous consequences. 
		The Home Office cannot say with any certainty how much it spent during 
		the year, what debts it was owed and what it owed to others or what 
		assets it owns. There is no assurance that all expenditure incurred 
		during the year was in line with what Parliament authorised and 
		financial information provided by the Home Office is unreliable. Those 
		are the most basic failures of financial stewardship and control by the 
		accounting officer who is legally responsible to Parliament to account 
		for how moneys are spent.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In that case, the accounting officer failed in his 
		duty to Parliament and one might have thought that the person 
		responsible would have been hauled over the coals, exposed and brought 
		to the Bar of the House to explain himself. What actually happened, 
		however, was that he was promoted to become Deputy Governor of the Bank 
		of England in charge of financial stability in the banking system, 
		which, if nothing else, at least shows that the people who run the 
		country still have a sense of humour.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">What I would like to know is where the Treasury is 
		in all that. The NAO memo goes on to state that</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;late qualified accounts are extremely 
			damaging to the Home Office&#8217;s reputation, particularly with the 
			Treasury who are likely to exercise closer scrutiny over the 
			unaudited resource budget outturn submitted to them each summer.&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">What assurances can the Financial Secretary give 
		us about the Home Office&#8217;s use of public money? Is the Treasury now 
		keeping a close eye on what happens? What supervision regime is now in 
		place? Is there now a Treasury hit squad inside the Home Office helping 
		to sort things out? How often does the Home Office have to report in and 
		tell the Treasury what it is doing? It has been a disgraceful episode 
		and I hope that it is soon sorted out.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I come to the national programme for information 
		technology in the health service. I do so with some trepidation because 
		I see that the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson) is in 
		his place. The last time I made a speech on this subject&#8212;it was some 
		years ago, I can reassure him&#8212;he said that he was glad that there were 
		anoraks in this place who were prepared to devote so much attention to 
		such areas and that he was very glad that he was not one of them. I have 
		to say that the problems have not gone away; if anything, they have 
		become worse. The scale of the national programme is simply huge. As the 
		NAO described it:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;The scope, vision, scale and complexity of 
			the Programme is wider and more extensive than any ongoing or 
			planned healthcare IT development programme in the world.&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">It started with the beguiling idea that 
		information technology offered enormous potential benefits for the NHS. 
		Above all, patient records could follow the patient smoothly and quickly 
		around the system, bookings could be made online, and doctors could 
		consult records easily in their surgeries and during their rounds. 
		Managers and clinicians could track and report on the work of hospitals 
		and trusts, on the prevalence of clinical conditions and on the success 
		of the health service in treating them. IT in the NHS seemed to offer 
		nothing short of a revolution. However, the problem was that the 
		revolution appeared to be outside the Government&#8217;s control. System 
		standards were being set at the centre, as they should be, but system 
		procurement was happening at a local and trust level.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000127">Kitty Ussher (Burnley) (Lab):</a></b> The hon. 
		Gentleman mentioned procurement. Will he join me in congratulating the 
		Department of Health on having secured the cheapest ever deal with 
		Microsoft across the whole world?</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000128">Mr. Bacon:</a></b> The hon. Lady may recall that 
		Sir Peter Gershon, when he was at the Office of Government Commerce, 
		negotiated a deal with Microsoft that saved the taxpayer £120 million. 
		As the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine) said earlier, there have 
		been serious problems with the public sector failing to exercise the 
		procurement power that it has, and I welcome any steps towards improving 
		procurement and using the purchasing power that is available.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In relation to the national programme&#8212;in which 
		Microsoft is not involved, by the way&#8212;the system standards have been set 
		at the centre, but procurement has happened locally. The whole process 
		must have seemed terribly slow to those who wanted to make things happen 
		more quickly. That was why, some years ago, the Prime Minister called to 
		a seminar the heads of some of the world&#8217;s largest IT companies. They 
		told him that there was no problem and that they could design, deliver 
		and install national systems across the entire NHS that would do 
		everything that the most optimistic advocate of health IT could want. Of 
		course, they said it would not be cheap and they quoted a figure of £2.3 
		billion, but, as the Prime Minister said, up to 600 million pieces of 
		paper would be saved a year.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Thus the national programme for IT in the health 
		service was born and with it a new bureaucracy, Connecting for Health. 
		Promises were made, headlines garnered and giant regional contracts were 
		duly let. However, five years on, where are we? For one thing, the cost 
		of the whole programme has inflated enormously. By 2003-04, £6.2 billion 
		worth of contracts had been placed and, in evidence to the PAC, the 
		director general of IT in the health service, Mr. Richard Granger, told 
		us that the figure is now £12.4 billion. The Minister of State for 
		Health has said that the figure is closer to £20 billion, although there 
		is some dispute about what he is including in that. In any event, those 
		are huge numbers.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000129">David Taylor:</a></b> Even taking the mean of 
		those projected figures, it suggests an overspend of £12.5 billion, 
		which would fund in total the trust deficits that the NHS is 
		experiencing for more than 20 years, which would take us moderately 
		close to the next Conservative Government.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000130">Mr. Bacon:</a></b> The hon. Gentleman ends on a 
		very optimistic note, and I join him in that. The fact is that the 
		numbers, as well as being very large, have been very varied. We have 
		heard £2.3 billion; £6.2 billion; £6.8 billion; £1.9 billion of central 
		costs, making a total of £8.7 billion; £3.4 billion of central costs 
		making £12.4 billion; £20 billion; and three to five times central 
		contract costs, which could push the figure to more than £30 billion. 
		The fact that the figures are so vague and varied is part of the 
		problem. The potential opportunity cost is also enormous, as the hon. 
		Gentleman points out.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000131">Dr. Pugh:</a></b> Apart from the central cost, 
		there is the serious issue of what the programme will cost individual 
		trusts and PCTs. No one will put a figure on that.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000132">Mr. Bacon:</a></b> The National Audit Office put 
		a figure of £3.4 billion on it, although how much that takes into 
		account the full costs is a moot point. One has only to read the board 
		papers of trusts around the country to see IT directors saying that they 
		are incurring costs that they cannot recover, in many cases including 
		costs that they incurred through the old information for health 
		programme that was stopped when the national programme for IT in the 
		health service was started and costs incurred on legacy systems. No 
		matter exactly what the sum is, it is definitely big. One could say that 
		cost overruns are nothing new; they are regrettable and to be avoided, 
		but they happen. However, surely in return for that vast forecast 
		expenditure we would now expect to be on the way towards a world-beating 
		IT system.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000133">Kitty Ussher:</a></b> Will the hon. Gentleman 
		explain where, within the scope of the motion that we debating this 
		evening, the report on IT in the NHS lies?</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000134">Mr. Bacon:</a></b> As the hon. Lady will know, 
		we have looked at the national programme for IT in the health service a 
		number of times during the last few years and I dare say that there will 
		be future reports. In fact, the National Audit Office has said there 
		will be other reports on it further down the line. It is a matter of 
		enormous importance to taxpayers and, I am sure, to all members of the 
		Committee.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">One of the suggestions that has been made by 
		Connecting for Health is that 750,000 prescriptions have been issued by 
		using the electronic prescribing service. One of the slightly alarming 
		facts is that only 1.5 per cent. of those were received electronically 
		by pharmacies and hence dispensed. The rest of them&#8212;some of 
		740,000&#8212;simply vanished into the ether, never to be seen or heard of 
		again. The thought of thousands of NHS staff typing pointlessly away is 
		a combination of industry and futility that I find rather depressing to 
		contemplate. The reason for that state of affairs is that, where systems 
		were put in place in GP surgeries, the corresponding systems were not 
		put in place in pharmacies, and sometimes vice versa. That is a 
		relatively small example of some of the problems. There are many others.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Perhaps the most important and difficult component 
		of the national programme is the delivery of patient administration and 
		clinical systems into acute hospital trusts. We should by now have 110 
		acute hospitals with patient administration and clinical systems in 
		place. The actual number is just 12. Of those 12, how many are clinical 
		systems? The answer is none. Not a single hospital-wide clinical system 
		has been delivered under the national programme.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The choose and book system should allow patients 
		to book appointments with doctors electronically. Almost half of all GP 
		referrals&#8212;some 8.5 million a year&#8212;are supposed to be made under that 
		system by September 2007, but so far we have only 300,000 bookings. The 
		number of bookings can found on the Connecting for Health website. What 
		is not on the website, but is true, is that by the Department of 
		Health&#8217;s own estimate, only about one quarter of the bookings that have 
		been achieved were made truly electronically; the remaining three 
		quarters were made by telephone.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">One redeeming feature in this rather grim scene is 
		that most of the forecast cost of the national programme has yet to be 
		spent. So far, total expenditure is about £1.5 billion. That figure of 
		actual expenditure so far was confirmed to the Committee by the director 
		general of IT in the health service. Although £1.5 billion is admittedly 
		rather more than the £654 million referred to in the National Audit 
		Office report, it leaves us wondering what sort of organisation can run 
		up almost £850 million of central administration costs before it has 
		even achieved its main aims. However, it remains true that many billions 
		of pounds have yet to be spent, so it may not be too late to turn back 
		from the road that we are currently on.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That is a crucial point. It is easy to think of 
		NHS IT as a complex and enormously expensive abstraction&#8212;as a subject 
		for techies and computer journalists, but not for politicians or the 
		national media. In fact, good IT systems offer enormous benefits to 
		patients and bad ones cause them direct harm. The national programme is 
		therefore an issue of great importance. The US firm Cerner, and its 
		partner Fujitsu, have the regional contracts covering the south of 
		England under the programme. It has recently been reported that Cerner 
		is also to enter into a contract with BT to deliver systems in London 
		after problems with another US software supplier, IDX. The Nuffield 
		orthopaedic centre in Oxford is the only trust under the national 
		programme now using the patient administration system offered by Cerner. 
		I have been shown a board paper from the trust, which shows that the 
		trust failed to meet its waiting list targets because IT system problems 
		meant that it could not identify which patients were waiting for what 
		treatment. The paper, by the director of nursing and operations for the 
		trust, states:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;the scale of the difficulties and the 
			duration of time that the problems persisted meant that 
			operationally it was impossible to maintain assurance that all 
			patients could be identified to be treated within appropriate 
			timescales.&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">In fact, the standard of the patient information 
		produced by the software system was so low that all the information had 
		to be checked and corrected manually. In other words, the trust and its 
		patients would have been better off with no electronic system at all.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In Birmingham children&#8217;s hospital, the patient 
		administration system was provided by the troubled UK firm iSOFT. A 
		series of problems in Birmingham culminated in the trust losing 800 
		children&#8217;s records in a fortnight. Some of those children turned up for 
		appointments entirely unexpectedly because their records could not be 
		found, while others were presumably not summoned for appointments that 
		they required. To give one more example, the child health system 
		deployed by BT in London lost so many children&#8217;s records that the number 
		of vaccinations given to children in the primary care trusts that were 
		even in a position to report any statistics went down by 18 per cent.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Volume 16, No. 25 of &#8220;CDR Weekly&#8221;, the Health 
		Protection Agency&#8217;s journal, stated:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;This is the third quarterly report in which 
			national trends could not be reported due to problems with new child 
			health systems being implemented in London. Comparing the year 
			2005/6 to 2004/5, the number of children in London who are missing 
			from the COVER programme is nearly 18,000 for children turning 12 
			months, over 14,500 for children turning 24 months and nearly 19,000 
			for children turning 5 years of age.&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">The number of children getting vital vaccinations 
		for measles, mumps, rubella, polio and so on fell by a fifth. The Health 
		Protection Agency commented:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;If new child systems fail to deliver ... 
			then children risk missing out on vaccination. Thus, they remain 
			unprotected and eventually will catch measles, mumps, and rubella 
			infections.&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">The HPA report continued:</p>
		<ul>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;Falls in coverage of this magnitude not only 
			indicate that individual children may be at risk, but also represent 
			a potential major public health threat to the control of the 
			diseases in the community.&#8221;</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="speechbody">Those are chilling words. It is extraordinary that 
		no clinical systems have been deployed under the national programme. 
		However, on reflection, given the damage that patient administration 
		systems now seem to be doing, perhaps that is just as well. The 
		implications of similar failures in clinical systems hardly bear 
		thinking about.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Finally, I want to deal briefly with the 
		consequences of the crisis in the national programme for IT contractors. 
		Mr. Granger, the programme&#8217;s director general, is fond of using 
		blood-curdling metaphors when speaking about IT contractors. He intends, 
		he says, to treat them like huskies&#8212;when one goes lame, it is shot, cut 
		up and fed to the rest&#8212;apparently, that keeps them keen. However, 
		managing a massive IT programme is not like running a dog sled. I 
		believe that that brand of macho management threatens to bring yet more 
		chaos to an already tottering system.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">By the end of March this year, the four major 
		contractors&#8212;BT, Accenture, Fujitsu and CSC&#8212;had received only £250 
		million in payments on£5 billion-worth of contracts.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">However, their spending in what I believe to be a 
		doomed effort to make the fundamentally flawed system work has been 
		massive. Accenture has wisely already set aside £260 million as 
		provisions against losses on the contract, but the remaining three 
		companies have remained strangely silent. By the end of March this 
		year&#8212;two and a half years in&#8212;BThad received just £1.3 million on its 
		contract of£996 million. My best advice indicates that BT has spent more 
		than £200 million trying to get systems up and running. That amount does 
		not yet figure in its annual accounts. I understand that BT intends to 
		replace its existing software supplier with Cerner, fresh from that 
		company&#8217;s poor performance at Nuffield. However, that means that most, 
		or perhaps all, of BT&#8217;s work in progress on the existing contract will 
		need to be written off. We have already seen what happened to the 
		software supplier iSOFT, when shareholders&#8212;</p>

		<a name="0607196000135">Mr. Speaker:</a></b> Order. I am most impressed 
		by the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s expertise on this subject, but it does not 
		relate to the matter before us. Although there will be other occasions 
		on which he will be able to raise the problems of the NHS, he must get 
		back to the matter in hand.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>
		<a name="0607196000136">Mr. Bacon:</a></b> Thank you for that guidance, 
		Mr. Speaker. I will rapidly draw my remarks to a conclusion and allow 
		other hon. Members to speak.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The national programme for IT in the health 
		service has been covered by the National Audit Office on several 
		occasions, as I am sure it will be in the future. It is the largest 
		civilian IT programme in the world and a matter of great importance. I 
		hope that it is also of great importance to the Treasury and that the 
		Financial Secretary will find time in his winding-up speech to refer to 
		the interest that the Treasury has in the matter, because the amounts 
		involved are so enormous that they could have huge consequences for the 
		Exchequer, fiscal policy and, indeed, the rest of the country.<br>
