		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given at 
			Wymondham High School on 19 October 2001</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
			<p class="speechbody">May I start by saying thank you very much for 
			inviting me to speak to you on this special occasion to celebrate 
			the achievements of the students and<b><span style="color:
red"> </span></b>pupils of Wymondham High School. It is a great pleasure to be 
			here and I feel honoured to have been invited.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="margin-left:0pt">There are many 
			things I have learnt in the twenty years since I left school which I 
			wish someone had told me earlier. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">In particular, about things like jobs, 
			careers, money, travel - the things that young people start thinking 
			about very seriously as they approach the time of leaving school and 
			indeed in<b><span style="color:red"> </span></b>the years 
			afterwards. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">When I first arrived at the House of Commons, 
			I sat in the library and wrote a long letter to one of my teachers, 
			simply to thank him. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Because when I was ten years old, during 
			English lessons when we had mini-debates, he made our class move our 
			desks around the room, so that at the end of the debate instead of 
			putting up a hand to vote we had to stand up and walk through the 
			gap created between two desks, just like the division lobbies in the 
			House of Commons, with 'tellers' there to count us as we went 
			through the gap. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">And that was when I first had the idea of one 
			day going to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament - and it 
			was one of my teachers, Mr Thompson, who gave me that idea. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Perhaps you will have been inspired by one of 
			the teachers here at Wymondham High School. Or perhaps by one of 
			your parents. Or a friend. Or a friend's parent. Perhaps you haven't 
			met that person yet. Perhaps you are just about to. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">But whether you have or whether you haven't 
			yet, remember that the person who knows best who you are, what you 
			can become and what you want out of life - the<b><span style="color:red">
			</span></b>person who knows better than anyone else what is in your 
			heart - is you. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Certainly, take advice - from people who have 
			more experience of life than you do.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Jobs, careers, money and travel are all so 
			important and the choices are now so extraordinarily varied that it 
			can be difficult to know where to start. And it can be very 
			worthwhile indeed to listen to what others who have experienced 
			those things have to say. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">But never forget that you are the sole owner 
			of what is inside your heart and that unless you have the confidence 
			to follow what you find there, you can't expect anyone else to - and 
			you may end up always wishing you had. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">On the subject of what job you should do, if 
			you believe in your heart that you can do something - what ever it 
			is - never, never let anyone persuade you that you can't, however 
			unlikely or difficult it may sound. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">And also never forget that while education is 
			exceptionally important, education takes many different forms, 
			academic<b><span style="color:red"> </span></b>education is not the 
			same as all education - and indeed that education by itself is not 
			enough. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Calvin Coolidge was right when he said: </p>
			<p class="speechbody">&quot;Nothing in the world can take the place of 
			Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common that 
			unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius 
			is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of 
			educated derelicts. Determination and Persistence alone are 
			omnipotent&quot;. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">If you have a dream, the place where the dream 
			came from is the same place where you will find the will power and 
			the determination to make it happen. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Don't be afraid to try a few different things.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Don't be afraid to make a few mistakes. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">There are philosophers who will tell you that 
			all of human knowledge is nothing more than the sum of human beings learning from our mistakes. And it was Winston Churchill 
			who said: &quot;Success is nothing more than going from failure to 
			failure with enthusiasm&quot;. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">A word about money. When starting out, don't 
			worry about not having enough money. It might seem like you should, 
			especially when<b><span style="color:red"> </span></b>you are having 
			conversations with your parents. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">But never let money <u>determine</u> the path 
			you take in life. There are successful people making more than 
			enough to live on - indeed, there are great fortunes which have been 
			made - in practically every area of human activity you can think of: 
			from making bricks to baking bread, from selling carpets to 
			designing car engines, from portrait painting to looking up at the 
			stars, and from being an accountant to being a rock singer. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">As long as you remember there is a key 
			difference between what you want and what you need, you will be on 
			safe ground if you first follow your heart and your instinct. You 
			will find that money will follow. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">And if there are any of you whose parents are 
			in total despair because you have decided to form a rock band, 
			remember that Virgil Thompson once said: &quot;I've never known a 
			musician who regretted being one. What ever deceptions life may have 
			in store for you, music itself is not going to let you down&quot;. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Don't be in too much of a hurry. Go abroad. 
			See a bit of the world. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Think about living abroad for a while and 
			learning a foreign language. If, when you leave school, you have 
			stamped clearly on your forehead - as I did - &#8220;Only a fool or a 
			saint would attempt teaching this boy a foreign language,&#8221; don't 
			worry. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">I was 28 before I spoke a word of a foreign 
			language or even realised it was something I might be able to do. 
			And there are few things more pleasurable once you've done it. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">If you don't have the money to travel, buy the 
			book<b><span style="color:red"> </span></b><i>'Work your way around 
			the World'</i> by Susan Griffith. You do not need money to go 
			travelling. You just need the will to do it. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">And if you pitch up somewhere and end up 
			working there, even if it just for a few weeks, you will find you 
			look at the place and its people quite differently than if you were 
			just a tourist - and you will have a much richer experience as a 
			result. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">In this century, spending time learning about 
			people overseas will be extraordinarily important. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">No one could have predicted 100 years ago what<b><span style="color:red">
			</span></b>the twentieth century would bring - the technological 
			developments, the enormous wealth, as well as world wars that killed 
			over fifty million people. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">And now we all have a responsibility to ensure 
			this century does not turn into a huge conflict between Islam - one 
			of the great religions of the world - and the West. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">The Chief Rabbi once observed that the holy 
			book of the Jewish people - the<b><span style="color:red"> </span>
			</b>Torah, the book of Jewish destiny - begins <u>not</u> with the 
			Jewish people. Instead it begins with Adam and Eve, with humanity as 
			such, created in the image of God. It goes on to Noah and the 
			Covenant made between God and all mankind. Only after eleven 
			chapters does it go on to Abraham, the grandfather of the Jewish 
			people - who was, of course, also the grandfather of Christianity 
			and of Islam. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Why, the Chief Rabbi wondered, does the book 
			of the Jewish people not begin with the Jewish people? </p>
			<p class="speechbody">And his answer? There is one proposition that 
			for thousands of years has brought grief to the world, and it is 
			this: that those who do not share my faith - or my race or my 
			ideology - do not share my humanity. At best they are second class 
			citizens, at worst they forfeit the sanctity of life itself. And 
			therefore the opening chapters of the most sacred<b> </b>book of the 
			Jewish people make it clear that our common humanity comes <u>first</u>, 
			that it <u>precedes</u> our religious differences. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Maurice Saatchi, one of the great geniuses in 
			the history of advertising, saw that while there are many things 
			that divide people of different countries - race, religion, customs, colour, language 
			- there are 
			many more that unite them. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">There is the need of all people to find the 
			answers to the great mysteries of life. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">There is the fear of isolation. The fear of 
			old age. The desire for your children to do well. The fear of death. 
			The need for food, heat, water, shelter, laughter, sex, tenderness 
			and beauty.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><u>Everybody</u> reacts to the sight of a baby 
			laughing or a beautiful landscape or a scene of violence. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">The responsibility for learning about people 
			overseas and for ensuring that we all seek to put <u>humanity</u> 
			first, rather than a particular faith - or race or ideology - rests<b><span style="color:red">
			</span></b>with this generation - with the young people in this hall 
			and elsewhere. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">It’s no good leaving it up to others. They may 
			be leaving it up to you. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">If all this sounds rather heavy, it's meant to 
			- because the consequences of getting it wrong do not bear thinking 
			about. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Let me finish then with four shorter and 
			somewhat lighter pieces of advice: </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Be someone's hero. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Marry only for love. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Count your blessings. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">And call your mother. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Thank you very much. </p>
