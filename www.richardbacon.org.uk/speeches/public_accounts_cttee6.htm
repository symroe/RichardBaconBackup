		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in the House of

			debate</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="articlebody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
		It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen 
		Goodman), and I should like to start by agreeing with her about the 
		importance of accountability. She also mentioned the possibility of 
		paying some civil servants more, something that Partnerships UK has 
		shown can be done. The Shareholder Executive to which she referred is 
		looking into the possibility of doing the same and, although whether 
		what has been done with the director general of the NHS IT service 
		produced value for money is still open to question, it is true that 
		civil servants can be paid more, and sometimes should be.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">The hon. Lady was also right to say that the PAC 
		must make sure that we are not regarded as being against the public 
		sector just for the sake of it. There are some very good examples of 
		good work being done in the public sector, and perhaps we could do a 
		little more to make that clear. However, the PAC deals with public 
		accounts, and that means that we must look at the accounts of public 
		bodies. When things go wrong, the people in charge&#8212;the accounting 
		officers&#8212;should expect to be accountable.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">The PAC&#8217;s Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for 
		Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), earlier called me an anorak, and I have 
		decided to try to rise to the challenge and prove him right. To that 
		end, I can tell the House that the Comptroller and Auditor General has 
		qualified 22 accounts including the armed forces pension scheme, the 
		Assets Recovery Agency, the Department for Work and Pensions&#8212;which has 
		had its accounts qualified since 1988&#8212;the House of Commons Members&#8217; 
		account, the NHS pension scheme, the NHS compensation for early 
		retirement scheme, the Revenue and Customs prosecution office, and the 
		Home Office.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">In addition, a further 15 non-resource accounts 
		are also qualified. They are Energywatch, the Ordnance Survey, the 
		Marine Fisheries Agency, the Council for Healthcare Regulatory 
		Excellence, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the HMRC&#8217;s trust 
		statement&#8212;which is a mere £1 billion or so adrift because of tax 
		credits&#8212;the Civil Nuclear Police Authority, the social fund, the Child 
		Support Agency client funds account, the NHS Pensions Agency 
		administration account, the Northern Ireland national insurance fund, 
		the British Transport Police, the Public Health Laboratory Service 
		board, NHS Direct and the Health Professions Council.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">I have read out the names of all those accounts 
		to make sure that they are on the record. I believe that every one of 
		the accounting officers involved should, as a matter of complete 
		routine, be required to report to our Committee to explain why their 
		accounts were qualified. Their job is to be the legal guardian of public 
		funds voted to them by Parliament, and to account legally for how that 
		money is spent. If, by marking the accounts as qualified in some way, 
		the CAG is telling us that he is not able, in certain respects, to form 
		an accurate opinion of how the moneys have been spent, the PAC ought to 
		know about it. We ought to know why he has qualified the accounts, and 
		we ought to discuss the matter with the accounting officers concerned. 
		In many cases, of course, we do know those things. The HMRC chairman is 
		a regular customer of ours. His accounts have been qualified in the past 
		three or four years because of tax credits, but that is a relatively new 
		development. However, I think that we ought to establish, as a routine 
		principle, that accounting officers come before us when accounts are 
		qualified.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">The Chairman of the PAC mentioned the Home 
		Office, whose accounts are qualified this year. They were disclaimed 
		last year, and one member of the Committee asked Sir John Bourn what 
		that meant. He replied that a disclaimer signified that he had no 
		information at all with which to form any opinion whatsoever. My hon. 
		Friend was right to mention that the Adelphi accounting system showed 
		the Home Office accounts to have £27.527 trillion. In the Home Office&#8217;s 
		defence, I point out that there was £27 trillion in both the credit and 
		debit columns, but the total is 2,000 times the size of the Home 
		Office&#8217;s actual turnover&#8212;and 1.5 times the gross domestic product of the 
		entire planet. The Australian auditor who had been put in charge of the 
		account inserted a rather blunt note to the Home Office audit committee 
		to the effect that there might be something awry. The figures suggest 
		that he might have been right.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">My first point, then, is that I believe that all 
		such matters should be referred to the PAC as a matter of routine 
		because accountability is so important. My second point has to do with 
		gateway reviews. That matter is a hardy perennial, and in the past the 
		Financial Secretary has made speeches explaining why gateway reviews 
		cannot be more public. I heard his predecessor&#8212;who is now the Secretary 
		of State for Communities and Local Government&#8212;use exactly the same 
		wording, and people who scrutinise the trade press will know that the 
		Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has used it too. It is clear 
		that someone in Whitehall knows how to do copy and paste, but that does 
		not alter the fact that not holding gateways in public has a deleterious 
		effect.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Several colleagues have mentioned the Rural 
		Payments Agency. Extracts from the gateway reviews are published in the 
		back of the report into the episode involving the RPA, which was in many 
		ways disgraceful. That means that they are available now, although they 
		were not at the time. After a rosy start in March 2001 where the</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20.0pt">&#8220;report concluded that 
		the proposed change programme has strong stakeholder support and a 
		focused and energetic management team&#8221;,</p>
		<p class="articlebody">three years later by May 2004, the gateway 
		review, now marked as red, stated:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;This is a complex 
		Programme requiring fundamental change in the way the Agency operates. 
		In respect of releases 1a and 1b, although testing has been delayed the 
		process is under good control, the problems are understood and we 
		believe that delivery will be successfully achieved in the coming 
		weeks.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Again and again one of the key points is testing being delayed or 
		compressed, and it was testing being compressed to a point where it was 
		inadequate which was one of the big problems in relation to tax credits. 
		The review went on:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;In respect of 
		releases 2 and 3, the combination of the timescale left, the number of 
		serious risks identified and the fact that the final policy decisions 
		will not be made until July, with the system well into design and build, 
		result in a critical situation that will require urgent action.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">They were designing and building a system although they did not know yet 
		what the policy was, which takes us back to what the hon. Member for 
		Bishop Auckland said earlier.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Some seven or eight months later, in January 2005, the gateway review, 
		still at red, found the review team under strong leadership but said 
		that</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;there is no room for 
		further change requests, which would lead the programme into serious 
		difficulties and overload the operation of the Agency.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Six months after that, in June 2005, still at red, the review said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The programme is in 
		considerable difficulties.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Anybody with a farming constituency could have told the team that. The 
		review continued:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The Agency have 
		sought to keep to the February timescale, but the risks of failing have 
		continued to increase. The team were concerned that there is not a 
		finalised and secured contingency plan, nor clarity about when it could 
		be invoked.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">There was still a further nine months before the chief executive was 
		removed from office.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">In May 2006, some two years after the first red review, the next red 
		review said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The computer system 
		performed well technically but the business processes required to use 
		it, in order to make full payments in the early part of the payment 
		window, were not fit for purpose.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">When read twice that seems to contradict itself. It basically says that 
		the computer system performed well but was not fit for purpose or that 
		the processes required to use it were not fit for purpose. That is the 
		sort of double Dutch with which the public, farmers and Parliament are 
		confronted. The conclusion, as if we did not know it, was:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The Agency is now in 
		crisis management.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">My point from all that is that had everything been more widely discussed 
		and publicised earlier, something might have been done earlier. The 
		Financial Secretary might say that I do not understand, as if the 
		gateway review had been public, these things would not have come out. 
		The point is that we were all able to tell from our own experiences at 
		the rock face that things were badly wrong, yet the process by which 
		things were put right was extremely slow.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Although several hon. Members including our esteemed Chairman have 
		referred to the Rural Payments Agency, everything that I have just said 
		is outside the terms of this motion because we have not yet had a reply 
		from the Treasury in the form of a minute. In future we should change 
		the wording of our motion slightly because we are unduly hidebound. I 
		refer to the Rural Payments Agency, the Olympic games, NHS IT and the 
		Dr. Foster NHS information services, to which the hon. Member for Bishop 
		Auckland referred. All four are important and of central concern to the 
		Committee, but all are outside the terms of this motion.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">We tend to rely on our esteemed Speaker or one of his deputies being not 
		au fait with the anorak work that we do to such a degree that on any 
		particular interstice or minutiae he or she cannot say whether something 
		is within the terms of the motion. It is unfortunate that we should have 
		to rely on that, as I found to my cost when I was trying to place on the 
		record some points about NHS IT last July only to find that the Speaker 
		had noted that they were outside the terms of the motion. I brought my 
		remarks to a slightly more rapid conclusion than I had proposed.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Choose and book, the doctors&#8217; appointment system, on which the NAO did a 
		report to which we have replied, and which has been the subject of a 
		Treasury minute, accounts for a small proportion of the total national 
		programme for IT in the health service. Although NHS IT is costing, 
		depending on whom one believes, at least £12 billion&#8212;if one believes the 
		NAO&#8212;and although it was thought of in February 2002, the contracts were 
		being let from autumn 2003 and here we are in the spring of 2007, it has 
		yet to be discussed properly in a debate in Parliament. Earlier this 
		week we issued a report saying that there is a significant danger that 
		the clinical benefits will not be achieved by the end of the contract 
		period. Our motion should be amended to take account in particular of 
		the reports to which the Treasury has issued a minute in response and, 
		more generally, to take account of the work of the PAC and the NAO. We 
		unnecessarily hamstring ourselves if we cannot talk about matters such 
		as NHS IT and the Olympic games.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">A very good article appeared in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on Tuesday on 
		that subject and I shall make it available to the Minister. I can 
		probably be forgiven for saying that I thought it was a very good 
		article because I wrote it myself<i> . [Laughter.] </i>It is certainly 
		worth his attention and I shall make sure he gets a copy.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Finally, since I know that two other Members wish to speak, I want to 
		talk about the efficiency programme. I am pleased to say that it is 
		certainly within the terms of the motion. The NAO produced a review of 
		the efficiency programme, on which we took evidence and on which the 
		Treasury has issued its minute. In the original NAO report a chart 
		showed the overall likelihood of delivery against the Gershon savings 
		and said that although significant chunks of the programme were good, 
		requiring only refinement, some were mixed with some aspects requiring 
		substantial attention and some were problematic requiring urgent 
		attention, a small percentage required <br>
		<meta content="19 Apr 2007" name="Date">
<NOTUS-DATE textMonth="Apr" year="2007"  month="4" day="19"></NOTUS-DATE>urgent 
		and decisive action and were &#8220;highly problematic&#8221;. In December 2004 that 
		amounted to 3 per cent. of the programme, but by December 2005 that had 
		increased by a third to 4 per cent. When I asked the then chief 
		executive of the Office of Government Commerce which Departments were 
		being referred to, his reply was, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that. That&#8217;s advice 
		to the Prime Minister.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Earlier this year we had an interesting seminar with the Chief Secretary 
		and chief executive of the Office of Government Commerce, to which a 
		number of members and former members of the PAC came. I showed the Chief 
		Secretary a chart which I got from the Office of Management and Budget 
		website. When the Committee visited the United States last summer we had 
		the opportunity to meet Clay Johnson, the deputy director in charge of 
		management inside the federal Government. They have a different 
		approach. Their score card is completely public and can be downloaded 
		from the website. Not only do they say which Departments are responsible 
		for which particular scores, but some Departments, for example the US 
		Department of Justice, put their traffic light scores in the lobby of 
		the Department so that all employees can find out where they stand. We 
		could learn a great deal from their much more open approach.</p>
		<p class="articlebody">Last summer I spoke at a conference at the French 
		Ministry of Finance. One of the other speakers was Barry Anderson, a 
		senior official at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
		Development. He used five words which are apposite. He said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Sunshine is the best 
		disinfectant.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="articlebody">We understand what we are here to do, which is to 
		scrutinise public money&#8212;money paid in taxes by constituents to the 
		Government for public purposes&#8212;and to discharge a trust. That trust can 
		be better discharged if there is greater openness and transparency. I 
		hope that the Treasury will take that on board because there is still 
		some way to go.<br>
