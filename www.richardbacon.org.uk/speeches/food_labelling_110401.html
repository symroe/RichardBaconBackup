  <h3>Food Labelling Regulations (Amendment) Bill
- Second Reading

</h3>
  <hr size="1" id="line"><br>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Richard Bacon (South Norfolk)  (Con):</strong> I beg to  move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">This is  my fourth attempt to bring in a Bill to amend the Food Labelling Regulations  1996 and my first opportunity, after seven years of trying, to get a Second  Reading debate. I am therefore very pleased to have this opportunity today. My  Bill seeks to amend those regulations to provide for information about the  country of origin of food to be made available to consumers. That is it; I am  not trying to restrict imports from anywhere.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I am not  trying to prevent people who love Spanish chorizo from buying as much of it as  they want. I am not trying to prevent people who want genuine German wurst from  buying it by the Mercedes Benz truck load and importing it into this country to  sell to all the people who want to buy it. I am not trying to prevent those who  are partial to kangaroo meat from buying that, either. According to the website  of J. M. Danslow, a quality butcher in Gravesend, kangaroo meat is</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;used  by some of the world's best restaurants because of its high quality and unique  flavour.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Those who  are partial to kangaroo meat have nothing to fear from my Bill. Those who like  bison, which is</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;the  most flavoured red meat available to today's consumer ...nutritious, tender and  easy to prepare&rdquo;,</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">can also  set their minds at rest.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Likewise,  no one who likes eating reindeer meat, which according to Danslow is</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;fine-fibred,  tender and lean&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">as well  as being</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;rich  in vitamin A, vitamin E and all vitamins B&rdquo;,</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">has any  cause for concern. I might add that there are other concerns about reindeer  meat, as the Swedish store Ikea found to its cost a couple of years ago when it  started selling salami made from reindeer in its UK stores at Christmas time.  The idea that Rudolf's big thank you for helping Santa to deliver all his  presents in double-quick time was to be chopped up and turned into salami for  the Christmas dinner table was a little too much for the nation's children and  their parents to bear. But, if there are still any secret reindeer meat eaters  out there following that debacle, they have nothing to fear from my Bill.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">My Bill  seeks to do one thing: I just want consumers to know where meat comes from. I  want them to know, not to think or to guess or to hope. If producers say on the  label that meat is British, it should actually be British. I have set out this  argument in the House on four previous occasions: on 22 March 2004; on 29  October 2008; and in a slightly different Bill on 17 March 2009, which is  identical to the Bill that I asked the Leader of the House to introduce on 11  January 2011. So I will not detain the House for very long.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr David Nuttall (Bury North)  (Con):</strong> I appreciate  that my hon. Friend has set out his arguments in the House before, but I and  other Members who are present 
    today were not here on those occasions, and we would very much welcome  listening to those arguments in some detail.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I hear what my hon. Friend says,  and I will set out a pr√©cis of the arguments for his benefit and for that of  other Members. I do not want to dwell on them at length, however, because I  also need to explore the aspects of European law that are unjustifiably held to  be fatal to the Bill.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I was  saying that the Food Labelling Regulations (Amendment) Bill that I introduced  in 2009 is worth some attention, particularly because of its sponsors. I  reiterate that that Bill is identical to today's Bill, save for the names of the  sponsors. My 2009 Bill had a range of sponsors from different parties,  including my right hon. Friend the Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Mr  Paice) and my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), who I am  delighted to see sitting in his place today. It is a great pleasure for me to  be able to introduce a Bill that I know has the support of two people who are  now Ministers in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I do not  wish to detain the House by talking about the cheating that goes on, but I will  briefly summarise the problem. The current rules do not do the job adequately,  and consumers continue to be misled. In the case of certain foodstuffs, no  indication need be given that the product is made with imported meat. Examples  include the Tesco chicken dinner in its range of children's meals, which simply  states &ldquo;Produced in the UK&rdquo;, although the chicken actually comes from  Thailand. Sometimes a phrase will be used to imply the country of origin. For  example, items from the Bird's Eye Great British Menu range turn out, on closer  inspection, to contain imported meat. At present, producers of imported meat  can lawfully use the Union flag on packaging to imply that a product is  British, even when it is not, and they do so. They can, and do, import meat  from overseas, package it here and say that it has been produced in the UK.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">There are  not many people out there who disagree with what I am saying about the need to  address the problem. An ICM poll for the Honest Food campaign showed that 87%  of consumers in the survey believe that the Government should ensure that the  country of origin is clearly shown on food products. The survey also showed  that 89% believe that when a product such as sausages or bacon is labelled as &ldquo;British&rdquo;  or &ldquo;produced in the UK&rdquo;, it should mean that the sausages or bacon  are from an animal reared in Britain.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The right  hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown) is a sponsor of the Bill.  When he was an Agriculture Minister 12 years ago in 1999, he told us:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;I  want to give clear unambiguous information on the real place of origin, not  place of processing or place of slicing; I want to clamp down on misleading  place of origin descriptions&rdquo;.-[<em> Official Report</em>, 28 October 1999;  Vol. 366, c. 1126.]</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">In the  last Labour Administration, the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food  and Rural Affairs, the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn) said:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;A  pork pie made in Britain from Danish pork can legitimately be labelled as a  British pork pie&rdquo;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">He added:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;That's  nonsense, and it needs to change.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I agree,  and so did the farming Minister at the time, Jane Kennedy, who was then the  right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree-and she is, I might add, very much  missed. She appeared on the excellent Channel 4 programme, &ldquo;Jamie Saves  our Bacon&rdquo;, and told Jamie Oliver that misleading labelling was &ldquo;a  disgrace&rdquo;. Once again, I agree.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Some  progress has been made with voluntary codes, but they are voluntary. As I said  in seeking leave to bring in this Bill, significant concerns persist about the  effectiveness of voluntary agreements, while the demand for mandatory  country-of-origin labelling continues to grow. Helen Ferrier, the chief science  and regulatory affairs officer for the National Farmers Union said of the  guidance from the British Retail Consortium:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Unless  all companies sign up and then consistently stick to their promises, some  consumers will still be misled.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Alice  Barnard, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance also welcomed the guidance  and urged food organisations to sign up to its standards, but she also  lamented:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The  code is not mandatory, which would offer further protection still.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">At the  annual general meeting of the National Federation of Women's Institutes in  2010, a resolution calling for the mandatory, clear labelling of food with its  true country of origin was passed unanimously. The Minister might like to  reflect that this is an organisation not to be trifled with, as a former Prime  Minister found out to his cost. The chair of the Women's Institute, Ruth Bond  said:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;We  know that consumers want to make informed choices, and surely it is not right  that consumers remain dependent on the goodwill of retailers signing up to a  voluntary scheme. Without legislation there is no guarantee that consumers will  get the choice and information they are demanding.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Let me  turn to deal briefly with the Bill. It is a very short Bill of two clauses,  including the &ldquo;Short title and commencement&rdquo;, so I suppose it is what  most of us would call a one-clause Bill. It provides definitions of meat  products under the rubric of &ldquo;Country of origin labelling&rdquo;. More  extended provisions explain in more detail the definition of &ldquo;Meat  component&rdquo; and the circumstances in which the word &ldquo;British&rdquo; can  be used-or where it cannot:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;No  meat product may be labelled 'British' unless the animal from which the meat  was derived was born, reared and slaughtered in the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">The key  issue I want to devote most of my time to exploring is whether there are fatal  flaws in the Bill because of European Union law. Some people believe that to be  the case, but I am not sure that it is. Let me start by pointing out the terms  of the EC directive-the original directive 2000/13/EC. It states in paragraph  (6) of the preamble:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The  prime consideration for any rules on the labelling of foodstuffs should be the  need to inform and protect the consumer.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Paragraph  (8) continues:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Detailed  labelling, in particular giving the exact nature and characteristics of the  product, which enables the consumer to make his choice in full knowledge of the  facts is the most appropriate&rdquo;-</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">and now  we come to the most interesting bit-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;since  it creates the fewest obstacles to free trade.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">More  detailed labelling means fewer obstacles to free trade. Paragraph (14) of the  preamble continues:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The  rules on labelling should also prohibit the use of information that would  mislead the purchaser&rdquo;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Moving on  from the preamble to the articles, article 2 states quite clearly in the first  paragraph:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The  labelling and methods used must not...be such as could mislead the purchaser to  a material degree&rdquo;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">All over  the directive, it is perfectly clear that the purpose is to protect the  interests of consumers.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">It is not  at all obvious therefore that what I am doing-it could easily be argued that I  am simply trying to transpose into UK law, albeit more effectively than  hitherto, the requirements of this directive-is in any sense contrary to  European law. However, I accept that there is an argument to be had. My  contention is that this is about consumer choice, not about restricting markets  in any way.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">In order  to make the point in more detail, let me turn to the leading text on the free  movement of goods. It is the fourth edition of &ldquo;Free Movement of Goods in  the European Community: under Articles 28 to 30 of the EC Treaty&rdquo;, by Mr  Peter Oliver. As it makes clear, an extant jurisprudence offers a considerable  opportunity for complex discussion. It states:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Article  28 (formerly article 30) provides: 'Quantitative restrictions on imports and  exports and all measures having equivalent effect shall...be prohibited between  Member States...the concept of measures of equivalent effect to quantitative  restrictions differs from quantitative restrictions themselves in that it is  considerably wider and more complex.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">In other  words, it is quite possible that even if someone was not trying-as I am not  trying-to restrict the imports of goods by providing that meat sold here must  be accurately labelled, that could be the equivalent effect although it was not  the intention, and article 28 prohibits measures that have the effect of  quantitative restrictions.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Edward Leigh (Gainsborough)  (Con):</strong> I  strongly support my hon. Friend's Bill, but I wonder what other countries in  the EU do. It is difficult to imagine the French, for instance, tolerating the  position that exists in this country, and they are better at protecting their  own meat market. Perhaps my hon. Friend can enlighten the House.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon:</strong> I will. I shall be citing a  number of cases that have been heard in the European courts, which illustrate  that not just the French but many other countries have come up against these  issues and that there is a developed jurisprudence.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">As Peter  Oliver says in his book,</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;in  determining whether a particular measure falls under Article 28...it is  imperative to proceed in two stages. The first question to ask is: does this  measure restrict imports (or exports) so as to be caught by Article 28...? If  so, then the second question arises, namely: is the measure nevertheless  justified in Community law and thus lawful?&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Oliver  examines explicitly the question of the obligation to make a declaration of  origin. He makes it clear that in &ldquo;certain circumstances&rdquo;, case law  has held-in the past-that</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;the  requirement that the importer make a declaration of origin is contrary to  Article 28. This was laid down in the Donckerwolke judgment, already  discussed&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">-earlier  in his book, that is-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;where  the Court held:</p>
  <p class="newsbody">'the requirement by the importing Member State of  the indication of the country of origin on the customs declaration document for  products in free circulation...does not in itself constitute a measure of  equivalent effect'&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">-in other  words, one that would produce the equivalent of quantitative restrictions-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;'if  the goods in question are covered by measures of commercial policy adopted by  that State in conformity with the Treaty.'&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">The  judgment went on to say, however-and this is the point-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;'such  a requirement would, however, fall under the prohibition contained in Article  [28] of the Treaty if the importer were required to declare, with regard to  origin, something other than what he knows or may reasonably be expected to  know'&rdquo;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I would  say that meat suppliers should</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;reasonably  be expected to know&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">where the  meat that they are supplying comes from.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">On the  face of it, the requirement would not fall under the prohibition in article 28.  Unfortunately for that line of argument, however-as Mr Oliver goes on to say-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;At  least since January 1, 1993, when Article 14&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">-the  former article 7A-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;of  the Treaty took effect, all obligations to make a declaration of origin  constitute measures of equivalent effect. The qualifications in Donckerwolcke,  which related to the now moribund Article 134...no longer apply.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">It might  be thought that that constituted &ldquo;Game, set and match&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I am  done middle stump&rdquo;-depending on whether a tennis or a cricketing analogy  is preferred-but even then it is not as simple as that, because the treaty also  contains article 30. Mr Oliver's book is devoted almost entirely to article 28  and article 30. The main exception, as he describes it-article 30-includes the  subject of mandatory requirements. Article 30 states:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The  provisions of Articles 28 and 29 shall not preclude prohibitions or  restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds  of&rdquo;-</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">and a  whole laundry list follows-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;public  morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life  of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing  artistic, historic or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and  commercial property.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">We could  drive a pyramid through that group of exceptions. That makes plenty of work for  lawyers, of course, but it also shows that the issue is not quite as clear as  some might try to make us believe.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Oliver  goes on to say:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;The  wording of this provision shows that it applies both to quantitative  restrictions and to measures of equivalent effect. Furthermore, it covers that  latter whether they are 'distinctly' or 'indistinctly' applicable.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">He  continues:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;it  is also clear from the wording of Article 30 that, subject to certain limits,  it merely entitles the Member States to exercise certain powers: it does not  oblige them to do so.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">We must  bear in mind that I am not trying to impose any restrictions on imports. I am  merely trying to ensure that the consumer has clear information. Therefore, my  proposals should receive the lightest possible interpretation in respect of  these rules.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Oliver  goes on to point out that as the European Court of Justice</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;held  in <em>Bauhuis v Netherlands, </em>Article 30'constitutes a derogation  from the basic rule that all obstacles to the free movement of goods between  Member States shall be eliminated'&rdquo;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">In other  words, such derogations are possible. Mr Oliver continues:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;To  be justified under Article 30, national provisions&rdquo;-</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">which is  what mine would be-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;must  fall within one of the grounds of justification covered by the first sentence  of Article 30&rdquo;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I think  mine do that. Public policy says there should be better information for  consumers so they can make informed choices, and public policy is one of the  justifications under article 30.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">As Mr  Oliver points out, to be justified under article 30 national provisions must  also</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;not  constitute arbitrary discrimination nor a disguised restriction on trade  between Member States and must be justified.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I am not  trying to put any disguised restrictions on trade between member states. I  simply want information for consumers, and what I am trying to do is certainly  not arbitrary.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">To  continue:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;the  Court in 'Cassis de Dijon'&rdquo;-</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">one of  the most famous cases in European jurisprudence-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;has  recognised a series of 'mandatory requirements' in addition to the grounds of  justification expressly set out in Article 30.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">As is  clearly set out in the book,</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;the  better view is that the 'mandatory requirements' fall under that  provision&rdquo;-</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">article 30-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;despite  the Court's traditional view that they were subsumed within Article 28.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">The  'mandatory requirements' recognised so far are: the prevention of tax evasion,  consumer protection, the prevention of unfair competition, the protection of  the environment, the improvement of working conditions, the maintenance of  press diversity&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="newsbody">and so  forth.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">To  continue:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;One  questions left open by '<em> Cassis de Dijon</em>' was the relationship between  the 'mandatory requirements' laid down by that judgment and Article 30, which  is not mentioned at all in the judgment. Two schools of thought evolved on this  matter:</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">(a)  According to the first view, the 'mandatory requirements' are to be weighed up  within Article 28, not Article 30. Moreover, only 'indistinctly applicable' measures  may qualify, so that 'distinctly applicable' measures may only be justified on  the grounds expressly set out in Article 30. On this view, therefore,  'indistinctly applicable measures' are granted more favourable treatment in  that the 'mandatory requirements' apply to them alone.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">(b)  According to the second view, the 'mandatory requirements' are regarded as  being subsumed under Article 30, on the grounds that they constitute additions  to the list of grounds of justification expressly set out in Article 30. On  this view, the mandatory requirements are subject to precisely the same tests  as the latter grounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Oliver  continues:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;In  support of the first theory, it should be said that the Court has repeatedly  held that Article 30 must be interpreted narrowly since it constitutes an  exception to a fundamental principle of Community law.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">He adds:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Yet  it is submitted that that is outweighed by the following considerations:</p>
  <p class="newsbody">(a) The  second view avoids the undue harshness resulting from the first theory with  respect to 'distinctly applicable' measures necessary on such grounds as  consumer protection. According to the first theory, even though they are  necessary, such measures are quite simply prohibited. According to the second  theory, they are considered to fall under Article 28, but may be justified  under 
  Article 30. Since the Court has now accepted that consumer protection may  justify restrictions otherwise prohibited by Article 28, does it make sense to  approach it differently from, say, plant health merely because in 1957 (when  the Treaty of Rome was first drafted) consumer protection did not yet arouse  much passion?&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Oliver  continued:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;It  always seemed clear that the 'mandatory requirements' have the same properties  as the grounds of justification in Article 30. As van Gerven&rdquo;-</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">the then  advocate-general-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;remarked  in <em>Aragonesa de Publicidad v Departamento de Sanidad </em>'...the conditions  governing the applicability of the <em>Cassis de Dijon </em>doctrine and of  Article [30] are the same&rdquo;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">He  continued:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;For  these reasons, the second approach has been firmly and consistently advocated  in this book since its very first edition, which appeared in 1982. This is  despite the fact that...the Court had already chosen to follow the other  approach, which was also backed by most commentators for many years.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr  Oliver's point in this text, which is one of the leading reference books on the  free movement of goods, is that the second approach is gaining favour. He  continued:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;What  is more, the Court has on occasion had recourse to some far-fetched-not to say  exotic-devices so as to maintain the fa√ßade that the 'mandatory requirements'  apply only to 'indistinctly applicable measures'. Thus the Court has been  driven to holding the following measures to be 'indistinctly applicable' so as  to be able to consider the 'mandatory requirements' at all: a German statutory  provision to the effect that only wines from certain specific regions of  Germany could be marketed in bottles of a particular shape; legislation  prohibiting the importation and marketing of meat products containing non-meat  ingredients; and a measure prohibiting the use of the letter R in a circle  (which indicates that a name constitutes a registered trade mark) unless such  registration had occurred in the Member States in question.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Perhaps  the most striking example occurred in <em>Commission v Belgium</em> (waste  disposal), which concerned a blatantly discriminatory ban on imports of waste  into Wallonia from other Member States.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Oliver  goes on to talk about a &ldquo;most welcome&rdquo; move made by advocate-general  Jacobs, whom I sat next to at lunch once in Luxembourg and I found to be a  thoroughly excellent chap. Mr Oliver describes how Mr Jacobs</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;has  criticised the Court's traditional approach on at least two occasions. In <em>Chemische  Afvalstoffen Dusseldorp v Minister van Milieubeheer &rdquo;</em>-</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">I think  that that is Dutch, rather than German-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;referring  to the last edition of this book, he acknowledged that the Court had been  'obliged to adopt rather tortuous reasoning' in the cases just mentioned and  most particularly in the <em>Walloon Waste</em> case. In <em>PreussenElektra v  Schleswag</em>, the same Advocate General went further, saying that 'the  reasoning in <em>Walloon Waste</em> is flawed and that 'it is desirable that even  directly discriminatory measures can sometimes be justified on grounds of  environmental protection', the latter being a 'mandatory requirement'. He then  added: 'In view of the fundamental importance for the analysis of Article 30 of  the Treaty of the question whether directly discriminatory measures can be  justified by imperative requirements, the Court should, in my view, clarify its  position in order to provide the necessary legal certainty'.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Oliver  goes on to say:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Without  expressly renouncing its earlier position, the Court has grudgingly moved in  this direction...first...in <em>Konsumentenombudsmannen v De Agostini</em>&ldquo;.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">That case  basically considered whether an outright ban on advertising certain products on  television, which was held to have a greater effect in some member states than  in others, could be justified.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">He  continued:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Likewise, <em>in Decker v Caisse de maladie des employ√©s priv√©s</em>, the Court considered  a 'distinctly applicable' Luxembourg rule requiring the prior authorisation of  the purchase of glasses from another Member State...in <em>PreussenElektra</em>,  blatantly discriminatory legislation on wind energy was held to be justified  for the protection of the environment (a mandatory requirement).</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Oliver  continued:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Although  these developments must surely be applauded, it is a pity that the Court has  not yet shown the courage to disown its earlier approach expressly, as this  would undoubtedly be in the interests of legal certainty.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">His  fundamental point is as follows:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;In  short, the view consistently espoused in all the previous editions of this book  has been gaining ground in recent years.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">Why  trouble the House with all this jurisprudence, especially as a non-lawyer? The  reason is extremely simple: I want to make it clear there is an argument to be  had. Indeed, having listened to what the Prime Minister has said on the subject  of food labelling, I venture to suggest that he agrees with me. He said at the  Oxford farming conference:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;Food  can be imported to Britain, processed here, and subsequently labelled in a way  that suggests it's genuinely British. That is completely wrong. I cannot  overstate the importance of enabling informed consumer choice. Effective  marketing can only be achieved if labelling is accurate and clear.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">He went  on:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&ldquo;I  know that this may raise issues with the European Union. But the role of a  Government that cares about British farming is not to sit on its hands and say  'there's nothing we can do', but instead to test these rules and if necessary  challenge and change them.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">That is  exactly what my Bill is designed to do and would accomplish, and I hope that  the House will read it a Second time.</p>
