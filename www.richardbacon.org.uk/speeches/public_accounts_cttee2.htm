			the House of Commons on
			29 January 2003</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk): </b>It is a 
		great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. 
		Steinberg). We have all been delighted and entertained by his enthusiasm 
		for the private finance initiative, especially in relation to his local 
		hospital. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I, too, want to 
		dwell on the PFI. It is a matter of great concern and affects much of 
		what the PAC does, in relation both to central Government projects, such 
		as buildings and computer systems, and to schools, prisons and 
		hospitals. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The work of the PAC 
		is of huge importance and I am privileged to be one of its members. 
		According to figures that the Committee has seen on just three aspects 
		of Government—Customs and Excise, health and social 
		security—between £16 billion and £24 billion of taxpayers' money 
		disappears in one way or another. I do not say that it is all 
		unaccounted for, as not all the accounts are qualified. Neither do I 
		pretend that it is easy to account for all such money, or someone would 
		have done so by now, but the figures show the large scale of Government 
		expenditure and thus the importance of the PAC's work. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The PFI has been the 
		subject of much comment and debate; it is a matter of some controversy. 
		The Institute for Public Policy Research recently pointed out that only 
		6 per cent. of PFI projects completed by central and local government 
		were subject to independent value-for-money examination by official 
		audit bodies. I discussed the 6 per cent. figure with the National Audit 
		Office, which suggested that it might be slightly higher depending on 
		how it is calculated. None the less, a substantial proportion of PFI 
		projects have not been independently evaluated. The institute called for 
		a full and independent review of value for money in the PFI to check 
		both that the schemes are expected to deliver value for money when 
		signed and that they deliver the predicted benefits once they are up and 
		running. During last year's conference season, the trade unions called 
		for a moratorium on the PFI until a full assessment had been made, 
		although they got short shrift from Treasury Ministers for doing so. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Health Committee 
		mentioned the PFI in its recent report on its work over the last 
		Session. It noted that its inquiry, &quot;The Role of the Private Sector in 
		the NHS&quot;, was undertaken in the knowledge that there had been a great 
		deal of controversy and debate about the merits and cost-effectiveness 
		of the PFI. The Committee sought to discriminate between polemical 
		evidence that was being advanced by both sides in order to reach a 
		balanced judgment. Its report noted: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Perhaps the key deficiency identified by 
				the Committee related to the lack of accessibility and clarity 
				in the data used to support PFI decisions.&quot; </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">The Audit Commission 
		recently published a report on the PFI in schools that was critical of 
		some of the early contracts. By measuring PFI projects against a control 
		group of traditionally funded schools, it concluded that the PFI had not 
		yet delivered some of the most important benefits expected of it. I 
		accept that those were early contracts and that lessons have been 
		learned—I am sure that that is what the Economic Secretary would say; 
		that is probably what he is writing down now—but my enduring impression 
		from my time on the Public Accounts Committee is that, across various 
		areas of Government, lessons that should have been learned from 
		experience often are not: they are ignored or forgotten. Regardless of 
		the merits of the case for the PFI, I hope that the Economic Secretary 
		will accept that neither the Treasury nor the Government generally has 
		yet succeeded in building a settled will in favour of the PFI. On the Committee, sceptics 
		include left-wing state socialists and right-wing free market chartered 
		accountants.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Rendel: </b>And one or two Liberal Democrats.
		</p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>Yes, 
		even one or two Liberals are sceptical about it. If there is a bandwagon 
		going, I guarantee that a Liberal Democrat Member will jump on to it. 
		With that kind of spectrum, who could possibly go wrong? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">If the Treasury wants 
		to persuade people of the merits of the private finance initiative, it 
		has to do at least two things. First, it should be much more open and 
		transparent. Secondly, it needs to do much more to allow competition, by 
		which I mean that it needs to allow PFI and conventional procurements to 
		compete with one another on similar projects and to run side by side in 
		the long term. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Let me take those two 
		points in turn. First, the Treasury simply needs to open up more. If it 
		is right about the PFI, what has it got to be afraid of? It can only 
		gain from greater public understanding of the arguments. It should be 
		open about professional fees, about which I shall say more in a moment, 
		and explain more about how an assessment is made, openly acknowledging 
		the other factors that are involved. If it involves using a balanced 
		score card, it should say so, and explain how that works. People 
		understand that value for money does not always involve buying the 
		cheapest—that is why we are not all driving around in Reliant Robins.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">An area in which we 
		need complete transparency is that of professional fees. The National 
		Audit Office's report on the PFI contract for the development of West 
		Middlesex hospital states that the cost of the advisers was made up of 
		£967,000 for financial advisers, £803,000 for legal fees, £204,000 for 
		project management, £128,000 for the quantity surveyor, and £237,000 for 
		&quot;Others&quot;, making a total of £2,339,000. What it does not say is that 
		those are not the total fees for the project, but only the fees paid by 
		the Department of Health. The professional fees paid by Bywest Ltd., the 
		PFI contractor for the hospital, are separate. When the witnesses 
		appeared before our Committee, I asked them to supply more details about 
		the other fees, and I await their answers with interest. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">PFI contractors are 
		in a position to pay their side of the professional fees only because 
		they know that they have a contract with the Government that in the end 
		will entitle them to receive annual unitary payments from the 
		Government. The taxpayer is therefore financing those fees. Hon. Members 
		have a right to know on behalf of taxpayers how much is being spent in 
		that way. The Treasury explicitly acknowledges that in relation to its 
		building in Great George street. I tabled several parliamentary 
		questions about that PFI project. The Economic Secretary is fortunate 
		that he did not hold that position at that time; the current Financial 
		Secretary had the burden or pleasure of answering them. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The answer to my 
		parliamentary questions was that the fees on the Treasury's side were 
		£3.223 million, and that Exchequer Partnership, the PFI contractor for 
		the Treasury building, paid £22.08 million. The total at 27 June 2002 
		was therefore £25,303,000 in professional fees. Given that the building 
		cost only £118 million to construct, according to Treasury figures, it is 
		odd that the professional fees should constitute such a high proportion 
		of the total. Common sense suggests that if one pays £118,000 for a 
		house, one would not expect to pay professional fees of £25,000 to the 
		solicitor and the bank. Even allowing for the higher fees that one would 
		expect for a complex project such as the Treasury building, it is odd 
		that the professional fees should be more than one fifth of the total 
		construction cost. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Sir Kevin Tebbit, who 
		is permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, said in evidence last 
		year that the fees in relation to the financing of a typical PFI project 
		should be approximately 1.2 per cent. of its net present cost. The net 
		present cost of the Treasury project is £170 million. Under my preferred 
		COTD - cash out the door - measure, the expected payments for the building 
		in the 35-year life of the contract, including the project's inflation 
		assumption, total £838 million. Again, the former Economic Secretary 
		provided the figures in an answer last year. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">If we use Sir Kevin's 
		rule of thumb of 1.2 per cent. for financing costs, one would expect 
		that the total fees for the Treasury building, with a net present cost 
		of £170 million, would be around £2,040,000. However, the actual fees 
		relating to the bond issue for the Treasury building are £6,968,000 for 
		Exchequer Partnership and £2,637,000 for the Treasury. Again, the 
		Treasury provided the figures. That is a total of just over £9.6 
		million, which is 5.65 per cent. of the net present cost. That is nearly 
		five times more expensive than the figure that one would assume using 
		Sir Kevin Tebbit's rule of thumb. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I asked Sir Kevin 
		whether he knew why the fees for the Treasury building were so high. He 
		assumed a somewhat Delphic appearance and replied that it was perhaps 
		not a good idea for him to tell the Treasury how to do its job. However, 
		I should like Ministers to explain why they appear to be spending so 
		much taxpayers' money all over the City. I wonder whether the Treasury 
		has decided that, after three years of falling stock markets and a 
		rather light deal flow, short of bidding for Safeway it is time to help 
		the City of London through some old-fashioned pump-priming. However, if 
		that is so, hon. Members should know about it. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Will the Financial 
		Secretary explain why I received two replies from her to the same 
		parliamentary question on fees? Both answers were received on 27 
		January. The code numbers for both are the same. Every reference number 
		is identical, but one answer states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">
		&quot;I refer the hon. Gentleman to the reply I gave him on 27th June 2002&quot;. 
		[<i>Official Report</i>, 27 January 
				2003; Vol. 398, c. 619W.], </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">yet the other states:
		</p>
	
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;I shall let the hon. Member have a reply 
				as soon as possible.&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">That suggests that 
		something has been missed, that the information has not yet come out or 
		that further expenditure has occurred. I await the reply with interest.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Treasury Ministers 
		will know that the bond issue by Exchequer Partnership for the financing 
		of the Treasury project was for £127,790,000, and that, with some 
		mezzanine debt and other shares and stock, the total capital involved 
		was £140, 965,000. What interests me is whether the bond that was issued 
		the other day, on 16 January 2003, by Exchequer Partnership (No. 2) plc 
		for £165,145,000 means that there is now a whole new tranche of fees to 
		be paid on top. If so, how much is involved? Are all the numbers that I am talking 
		about in relation to the Treasury building only half the picture? Does 
		Exchequer Partnership (No. 2), which covers only the eastern end of the 
		building, mean that all these fees should be roughly doubled? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Why in the new 
		Exchequer Partnership (No. 2) bond issue, in the many crates of 
		documents relating to the new bond that are available for inspection at 
		Allen and Overy, or indeed at the Financial Services Authority, is the 
		financial model not disclosed, contrary to previous practice? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Incidentally, what 
		precisely were the benefits to the public purse in breaking the PFI 
		project for the Treasury building into two parts? Members of the 
		Committee went round the building. I walked all the way round it, and it 
		definitely looked like one building to me. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">While on the subject 
		of openness, may I say that when I asked the Ministry of Defence about 
		fees it gave me figures only in relation to its side, and not in 
		relation to the PFI contractor, Modus Services? The Treasury has been 
		admirable in answering these parliamentary questions in relation to both 
		sides, and rightly so, because ultimately it is the taxpayer who bears 
		the cost. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Treasury 
		professional fees are just over 10 per cent. of the total. On the same 
		basis, given that the MOD is paying out in relation to its PFI building 
		fees of £11,190,000, one might expect roughly another £107 million of 
		fees for Modus Services Ltd., the PFI contractor for the MOD building. I 
		do not know whether that is too high or too low. It is certainly 
		plausible. The fees for the London underground are already around £400 
		million, although how much has been achieved for that is a subject for 
		another day and a separate debate. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The point is that 
		the taxpayer has a right to know. If the Treasury seriously expects 
		people to come on side in relation to the PFI, we must know the facts. 
		It is no good saying, as the MOD did in its answer to me, that the fees 
		paid by the MOD are available but that the fees for the PFI contractor 
		are not. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Geraint Davies </b>: 
		As the hon. Gentleman is focusing on the PFI, may I ask him what he 
		thinks will be the impact of the change of the Treasury's discount rate 
		on the present value of PFIs from 6 per cent. to 3 per cent. and on the 
		number of PFIs coming forward and their relative value to public sector 
		comparators? </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I 
		shall come on to the public sector comparator in a minute. Answers I 
		have received from the Treasury, although how much credence one can 
		attach to them is a moot point, show that the Treasury view would be 
		that the discount rate cannot be seen in isolation. I talked to the 
		National Audit Office about the discount rate. Its view is—and this is a 
		point that I shall come to when I talk about the public sector 
		comparator—that, although one clearly needs to take note of the discount 
		rate, even more important is the question of the risk factor, the way in 
		which capital risk costs and risk factors for a variety of different 
		items that go into the calculation are assessed. I was going to say 
		&quot;manipulated&quot;, but I shall leave out such a tendentious word. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">If we are to get the 
		public on side, the Treasury must be more open about this matter. As I 
		have said, it is no good the MOD's saying that its professional fees are
		available but that the fees paid by the 
		contractor, Modus Services plc, are a matter for Modus Services plc, as 
		if that is that. We need to make fair comparisons if we are to 
		understand the PFI and weigh it in the balance. The Government have more 
		work to do in selling the PFI. Inadequate and unhelpful replies do not 
		assist their case. Such replies only make one think, rightly or wrongly, 
		that there is something to hide.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The second area I 
		want to address is the question of the Treasury's allowing more 
		competition, by which I mean competing types of procurement. It is all 
		very well saying that the investment programme through PFI is only 
		around 10 per cent. of current Government investment. I attended the 
		seminar held at the Treasury last year, which was very helpful. The then 
		Chief Secretary quoted that figure. I think that he said that £3.5 
		billion was going through the PFI and about £35 billion was going 
		through conventional routes, but if we look at the current building 
		programmes in our constituencies - schools, hospitals or prisons - it 
		certainly does not seem like that. If one asks my local education 
		authority in Norfolk how much choice it has as to which kind of 
		procurement to adopt, it will reply that the answer is zero choice. It 
		is told &quot;You want some money? This is how you get it.&quot; That is hardly 
		the best way to assure ourselves that taxpayers' money is being spent in 
		the most efficient, effective and economical way. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The best test would 
		be a live ongoing test. Procurements could run side by side for 
		different projects in similar areas. For example, one could allow some 
		school contracts to be let under the private finance initiative and 
		others by conventional methods. That would give a better basis for 
		assessing whether the PFI was delivering the claimed benefits and 
		whether mistakes from earlier contracts had been learned. At the moment, 
		we are just assured that that is the case. The fundamental point is that 
		we should subject the PFI to ongoing competitive pressure from other 
		forms of procurement. At the moment, Ministers reassure us that 
		everything is rosy because the project has been compared with the public 
		sector comparator. We are supposed to take that at face value. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">On the public sector 
		comparator, which the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Geraint Davies) 
		mentioned, the Ministry of Defence building report &quot;Redevelopment of MOD 
		Main Building&quot; has an interesting chart on page 24. It shows the public 
		sector comparator broken down by different categories. The left-hand 
		column has a figure of base costs for capital expenditure, replacements, 
		operating costs, legislative change and so on. There is also a risk 
		factor. The middle column has a number and the right-hand column has a 
		percentage. For example, the base cost for capital expenditure is £208.6 
		million. The risk, as a percentage of the base cost, is 29.5 per cent., 
		making a further £61.5 million. At the bottom of the chart is a total 
		base cost of £643.3 million. If all the risks are added up as a 
		percentage of the base costs, they amount to a further £102.9 million. 
		Miracle of miracles, the total is £746.2 million, which is the public 
		sector comparator. Guess what? The PFI came in at £746.1 million.</p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Flight: </b>Not £745 million? </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>No, 
		the PFI was much closer than that. There was only £100,000 in it. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I had a pocket 
		calculator with me at the hearing and thought that the sum looked 
		strange. It was almost dodgy: how could it be that close? Having done 
		some calculations, I decided that a bit of jiggery-pokery had been going 
		on. If we reduce the 29.5 per cent. figure, which is quoted as the risk 
		as the percentage of base costs for capital expenditure, by 0.5 of 1 per 
		cent., from 29.5 to 29 per cent., instead of the public sector comparator 
		looking £100,000 more expensive, it suddenly looks £1 million cheaper. 
		If instead of going from 29.5 per cent. to 29 per cent. we go down to 25 
		per cent., it looks £10 million cheaper. If we go down to 20 per cent., 
		it looks £20 million cheaper. The question arises: how was the figure of 
		29.5 per cent. reached? What is so miraculous about it? What makes it so 
		special? Why is the risk for &quot;legislative change&quot; 4.6 per cent.? Why is 
		it not 3.6 per cent. or 9.6 per cent.? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I share my concerns 
		about the public sector comparator with the hon. Member for Hemsworth 
		(Jon Trickett). He used to be a building contractor. If his clients 
		queried a price, I can only imagine what their reaction would have been 
		had he said, &quot;Don't worry, chum. I've put in this capital expenditure 
		risk factor here of 29.5 per cent. on top of the base costs. Experience 
		shows that this factor varies between 2 and 51 per cent. So if you take 
		the difference between the two, divide it by two and add a little bit 
		for a rainy day—if you really feel like it, divide by two thirds of the 
		square root of the number you first thought of, then the 29.5 per cent. 
		does indeed seem, well, how can I put it, guv, absolutely bang on the 
		nail. You've definitely got the best possible price available.&quot; I 
		imagine that had the hon. Gentleman said that, he would have got an 
		answer involving some plain Anglo-Saxon words, possibly mentioning brass 
		knobs. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The plain fact is 
		that the public sector comparator provides enormous scope for 
		manipulation to get the answer one wants by exploiting the inherent 
		uncertainties of any given situation and the complexity of the financial 
		models. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Jenkins: </b>As 
		someone who has been involved in the public sector, I have made 
		decisions on purchasing and refurbishing contracts. If a contract came 
		that close to the figure, I would have severe doubts about going down 
		the PFI route. The marginal cost of maintaining my staff, expertise and 
		ability to use my staff in future would make me decide firmly in favour 
		of the public procurement route. <i>[Interruption.]</i> </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I 
		would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would rephrase his question 
		succinctly. I did not hear all of it because of undoubtedly incisive and 
		eloquent chuntering on the Front Bench. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Jenkins: </b>If 
		there was a close decision between PFI and public procurement, as 
		someone who has had experience of such decision making, I can assure the 
		hon. Gentleman that I would go down the public procurement route because 
		it would mean that I could keep my staff, make a contribution to my 
		overheads and be allowed to compare contracts as I would have a control 
		group capable of putting a package together. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I 
		agree that a control group has merits. One does not have to rely on 
		assurances from Ministers at the Dispatch Box that all the lessons that 
		could be learned have been learned, and that everything is being done in 
		the best possible way with the possible best motive for the best 
		possible result, as one has something that one can look at. That point 
		was made in a report, not by the National Audit Office, which advises 
		us, but by the Audit Commission. A bit of competition between audit 
		bodies does not seem to do anyone any harm. It may be true that those 
		schools contracts referred to in the Audit Commission report were early 
		phase contracts, but that is no reason why we should not go forward with 
		some new conventional procurements so that we can run different systems 
		side by side. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">One worry about the 
		contracts that I mentioned earlier is the fact that they are long term. 
		The contract for the Treasury building, for example, runs for 35 years, 
		as does the contract for West Middlesex university hospital. The 
		contract for Norfolk and Norwich university hospital is for 60 years, 
		with a break at 30 years. A short PFI contract lasts 20 years. The worry 
		is whether it is possible to write a sufficiently flexible contract to 
		allow for huge changes that could occur over such lengthy periods. 
		Meanwhile, of course, annual unitary payments are obligatory. I 
		appreciate the point that the Treasury frequently makes about 
		acknowledging the need to pay whole-life costs, but the rational 
		decision may be to let something decline because the resources are 
		needed for something else. We need to consider whether the PFI allows us 
		sufficient flexibility to do that. Running the two systems side by side 
		would be a great way to check that in real time. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Frank Field 
		(Birkenhead):</b> As I was late arriving for the debate, I may not be 
		successful in catching your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. However, as the 
		hon. Gentleman is talking about the Ministry of Defence contract, it is 
		invaluable to have the NAO evaluation, which compares the PFI with a 
		more traditional redevelopment route. Basic questions need to be asked. 
		If we assume that the MOD has more than 700 rooms, the redevelopment 
		contract comes out at more than £1 million a room. Is any redevelopment 
		costing that much sensible, given that the total cost of the contract is 
		three times that for the new parliamentary building? </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I 
		have a lot of sympathy with the right hon. Gentleman's point. Asking 
		simple, fundamental questions is an important part of what our Committee 
		does and I am staggered by the extent to which they are often not asked 
		in Whitehall. When I asked the finance director of the NHS how much 
		taxpayers' cash he expected to pay out, making allowances for inflation, 
		during the lifetime of the contract for West Middlesex hospital, he did 
		not know. He did not know the answer to that basic question. He did not 
		know how much money he was spending, even though he had come to our 
		Committee to talk about precisely that. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">One of the Treasury's 
		own advisers described the public sector comparator as &quot;cretinous&quot;. The 
		NAO is usually a paragon of understatement. As a member of the PAC, I 
		have learned to savour its understatements like a fine burgundy. One of 
		my favourite reports was entitled &quot;Inappropriate adjustments to NHS 
		waiting lists&quot;, it was about managers fiddling the figures. Yet even the NAO was moved to describe the public 
		sector comparator as &quot;pseudo-scientific mumbo jumbo&quot; which leads to 
		&quot;spurious precision&quot; and </p>
		
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;a temptation to fiddle the figures&quot;. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">By its elegant and 
		reserved standards, that is little short of apoplectic. Will the 
		Financial Secretary assure us that the public sector comparator will be 
		put out of its misery as a principal tool for decision making on PFI 
		projects? At least, if it is not, I should be grateful for an 
		explanation of how much longer we will have to flog this dead equine, 
		which I am willing to do if required. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Will the Minister 
		acknowledge that, for schemes of the same type, such as school schemes, 
		it makes sense to run some PFI schemes alongside conventional 
		procurements? That would help to measure outputs properly over the long 
		term, and to maintain competitive pressure. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Will the Financial 
		Secretary explain why the professional fees for the Treasury building 
		were so high? How much more is there still to pay? How much cash is the 
		taxpayer going to have to part with in total over the life of the 
		project, including the eastern part of the building? Should I double my 
		figure of £838 million? Why is the financial model for Exchequer 
		Partnership (No. 2) not available for inspection at lawyers' offices and 
		at the FSA? How does that square with the aim of becoming more open, 
		transparent and accountable, which has been central to my remarks? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Finally, it is a huge 
		pleasure to be on the Committee. I should like to thank Sir John Bourn 
		and his staff, particularly the assistant auditors general, especially 
		Jeremy Colman and Caroline Mawhood, with whom I have had close dealings. 
		I also want to thank the NAO press office staff who do a tremendous job 
		in promoting the work of the office and the Committee. Finally, I want 
		to thank the people in the Clerks Office, Nick Wright, Richard Poureshagh 
		and Ronnie Jefferson, who also do a tremendous job. They are very long 
		suffering and hard working. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I look forward to the 
		Committee's work in the year ahead.
