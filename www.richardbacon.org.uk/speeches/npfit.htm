			11 November 2004<br>
&nbsp;</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> I am pleased to have 
		the chance to speak in this debate. The motion calls on the Government
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt" ?tabletext>&quot;to ensure 
		that the NHS Programme for information technology delivers the choice of 
		suppliers and functionality which general practitioners need&quot;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I wish to focus specifically on that issue. The IT programme in the 
		NHS is undoubtedly of huge importance, but GPs have serious concerns 
		about it, not least because they are, at the moment, the controllers of 
		information about patients. Eventually, under the proposals, it is 
		likely that most information will be held centrally and a wider range of 
		people will have access to it. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Worryingly, many of the characteristics of the most famous IT fiascos 
		in the public sector - there are examples almost everywhere one looks - are 
		exhibited by the national programme. The first is what the elder George 
		Bush called &quot;the vision thing&quot;. While for most undertakings some sense 
		of where one is going is necessary, a grand vision for IT projects can 
		be the most dangerous thing to have. Tony Collins, the specialist 
		computer journalist, writes in his book &quot;<i>Crash: Ten Easy Ways to Avoid a 
		Computer Disaster</i>&quot;: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">&quot;In computer 
		disaster terms a vision is an essential first step&quot;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">All the evidence and reports that the Public Accounts Committee sees 
		suggest that failed IT projects have in common the failure to take 
		things step by step, the failure to build on what is already known, the 
		failure to be incremental and infection by the vision thing. The 
		national programme exhibits the vision thing in huge measure. It will 
		cost £6.2 billion with an unknown amount on top for implementation. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The second problem is lack of consultation. In the Criminal Records 
		Bureau fiasco, there was a huge lack of consultation. An August issue of
		<i>Computer Weekly</i> contained a survey by Medix that found that </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">&quot;Doctors 
		feel left out of NHS IT plans&quot;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In answer to a question about how much information they had had about 
		the IT project, 3 per cent. said that they had had a lot of information, 
		26 per cent. had had some information, but 31 per cent. had had not much 
		information, 29 per cent. had had no information but had heard of it, 
		and a further 11 per cent. said that it was the first they had heard of 
		it. In other words, 71 per cent. of those responding had had little or 
		no information. In answer to a question about what consultation they had 
		experienced personally about the IT project, 10 per cent. said that it 
		had been barely adequate, 15 per cent. said it had been inadequate and 
		70 per cent. said that they had experienced none - a total of 95 per cent. 
		of the respondents. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The third characteristic of IT disasters, which will be worryingly 
		familiar to students of such matters, is a high turnover of staff 
		involved. Sir John Pattison, one of the original architects and the 
		first senior responsible owner of the programme, has gone. Lord Hunt, 
		who was the Minister in charge, has gone. Richard Granger, the director 
		general of IT in the health service, slums along on a salary of £200,000 
		and is the highest paid civil servant in the UK, but he earns a lot less 
		than he would in the private sector. I attended a conference recently 
		that had promotion stands for local service providers and I mentioned to 
		one of them that I had heard that Richard Granger would be moving on 
		soon and they said that they had heard that too. We shall watch eagerly 
		to see how long Mr. Granger remains in his job now that the LSP 
		contracts have been let. Of course, he was never responsible for 
		clinical buy-in to the programme; it was explicit that he had no 
		responsibility for getting clinicians involved. The Department of Health 
		suddenly noticed that that was a bit of a problem, so rather late in the 
		day - in March 2004, two years after the announcement of the programme - it 
		appointed Dr. Aidan Halligan, the deputy chief medical officer, as the 
		joint senior responsible owner of the programme. Yet six months later, 
		in September, we found that Dr. Halligan was to return to his native 
		country to take up a post as the head of the health service in Ireland, 
		having achieved more or less nothing in terms of clinical buy-in during 
		his six months in the job. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The fourth characteristic is indeed buy-in and most projects that do 
		not work fail in that respect. That is where the alarm bells really 
		start to ring. What must be, even for students of IT disasters, the 
		locus classicus of such disasters was the Wessex regional health 
		authority, where there was a Department of Health project for a central 
		system that had to be imposed regionally, and a key issue was the 
		failure to achieve clinical buy-in. It simply did not happen, so the 
		district health authorities refused to fund the project and the 
		Department had not choice but to cancel it. The fear is that primary 
		care trusts will be put in a similar position and will not have 
		sufficient funding to make the programme work, especially when their 
		clinicians do not want it, do not like it and do not trust it anyway.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Clinical buy-in is incredibly important, because clinicians need to 
		understand who has put the data into the system. They are unlikely to 
		trust data unless they know how it was acquired and whether it is 
		reliable. There is also a huge question about who will have access to 
		such data. Are the proposed controls on access and the security 
		protocols adequate to the task? Do they meet the concerns of GPs and 
		patients about maintaining the privacy of what is often sensitive 
		information? There is implied consent in data going up to the national 
		spine in the programme; even if patients do not give consent, the data 
		will be wrapped so that it is not easily readable. I was told today that 
		consultants can look at any data, including that of patients who are not 
		their own, and change the consent tag without obtaining the patient's 
		permission. There are serious concerns about access to data, as well as 
		about clinical buy-in generally. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The fifth characteristic often found in failed IT projects relates to 
		funding. The Minister of State, who, sadly, is not in the Chamber at the 
		moment, did what can only be described as a magnificent job in adding to 
		the confusion in an interview on Radio 4 a couple of weeks ago, which 
		was lovingly and forensically reproduced in <i>Computer Weekly</i> under 
		the headline, &quot;Health Minister adds to uncertainty over implementation 
		costs of the NHS IT plan&quot;. It included a photograph of the Minister in 
		which he is gesturing. I think that he is trying to explain something 
		but unfortunately his expression makes him look like a white rabbit 
		caught in a headlight, so whether he is on the receiving end of 
		something or trying to give an explanation is not clear. What is 
		certain, however, is that he did not make things easier to understand 
		when he said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">&quot;We think it 
		is going to cost the same&quot;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In other words, the £1 billion currently being spent on IT in the 
		health service will cover all the changes required, taking no account of 
		the fact that there is a series of IT issues in the health service, such 
		as finance, payroll, manpower, staff rostering and the procurement of 
		food and clinical and other services, as well as specialist equipment 
		for immunisation programmes, none of which has anything to do with the 
		national programme for IT. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) received a little 
		more clarity when pursuing a question put by my hon. Friend the Member 
		for Westbury (Dr. Murrison). The Minister said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">&quot;Future 
		funding to the NHS determined by the SR2004 expenditure settlement will 
		enable trusts to achieve the target of 4 per cent. for total NHS 
		spending on IT, set by the 2002 Wanless Report.&quot;[<i>Official Report</i>, 4 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 393W.]</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Four per cent. is much higher than the current figure so that is not 
		consistent with the statement, &quot;We think it is going to cost the same&quot;. 
		Any light that the Minister of State can shed in the wind-up will be 
		most welcome. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">To summarise, we have a massive vision, even though we know that in 
		IT the vision thing is one of the most dangerous elements; indeed, it is 
		a key ingredient of any computer disaster. We have lack of consultation 
		on a spectacular scale. We have a high rate of staff turnover, although 
		it has not yet reached the rate achieved during the implementation of 
		the national probation service information systems strategy, which had 
		seven programme managers in seven years, five of whom knew nothing about 
		project management. One fears that we may be reaching that point. We 
		also have a lack of buy-in - always a key worry, and in this case buy-in 
		by clinicians, the people who matter the most - and we have huge questions 
		about funding. This is a hardly a recipe for certainty or confidence and 
		it is hardly surprising that <i>GP</i> magazine has said of the national 
		programme for IT in the health service that it is likely to be more of a 
		fiasco than the dome. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">All of this is before one takes into account the effects of the new 
		GP contract, and the way that it interlocks and dovetails, or, rather, 
		does not interlock and dovetail, with the local service provider 
		contracts that Mr. Granger has been so busy letting at such a high 
		speed. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. 
		Lansley) mentioned, the GMS contract says in paragraph 4.34: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">&quot;Each 
		practice will have guaranteed choice from a number of accredited 
		systems&quot;,</p>
		<p class="speechbody">but the local service provider contracts, which are roughly £1 
		billion apiece across the country, say more or less the opposite; that 
		LSPs can impose a main system on local commissions with one alternative.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">This brings us back to a point that was made earlier about the EMIS 
		system, which is currently used by 55 per cent. of general 
		practitioners, which is not involved in any of the local service 
		provider contracts, unfortunately; mainly because the company could not 
		get professional indemnity insurance because of the risks that insurers 
		thought that it, as a relatively small company compared with the very 
		large contractors who are LSP contractors, would have to take on. So we 
		have the ludicrous situation in which GPs are in some cases having to 
		turn away from a system that works, the EMIS system, and turn towards a 
		system that in some cases has not even been written yet. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Until recently I was not familiar with the phrase &quot;vapourware&quot;, but I 
		am told that it means a system that exists, so far, only in someone's 
		head; it has not even reached the back-of-the-envelope stage. No one who 
		knows anything about EMIS or Vision or any of the other systems would 
		say that they are perfect, but at least they were incrementally 
		developed. They were not infected by the vision thing, they responded to 
		what local clinicians wanted, they have continued to change in response 
		to the needs of GPs in helping their patients, and GPs like the systems 
		and want to carry on using them. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Department reckons that, given the choice between getting 
		something for free and having to pay for a system like EMIS, GPs will 
		choose to go for something that is free. The Department is probably 
		right that some of them will, but I think that it will be surprised, and 
		I predict that many GPs will choose a system that they know, trust and 
		understand, even if they have to pay for it. The point is that they 
		should not have to pay for it; there should be no discrimination in 
		funding between systems that GPs can rely on and ones that are still in 
		the ether. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The areas that I would like to see the Minister focus on in the 
		wind-up are as follows. First, specifically in relation to EMIS, will 
		the Minister give a guarantee that there will not be an imbalance in the 
		funding between systems such as EMIS and systems provided by the 
		national programme for IT? Will Ministers listen to GPs' ongoing 
		concerns about the potentially huge problems of data transfer? The other 
		day I received a letter about that from a GP in Suffolk; the problems 
		are potentially enormous. Can the Minister say whether the national 
		programme understands better the benefits of the project rather than the 
		risks, because where things go wrong it is nearly always the case that 
		people have underestimated the risks? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Should £6 billion of contracts have been signed before it was known 
		what the overall costs would be, including the costs of local 
		implementation, before it was known what changes in business processes 
		would be necessary, before it was known whether clinicians would use 
		systems that were sought to be imposed centrally, before it was known 
		how the benefits would be measured, before it was known whether GPs 
		would oppose any handover of control of the confidentiality of their 
		patient records and before it was known whether there were enough 
		in-house skills to translate national plans into local action? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Finally, the National Audit Office, interestingly, has already 
		announced an investigation into the national programme, which may shed 
		light on some of these questions. But in the meantime I look to the 
		Minister for an assurance that GPs will not be forced to replace 
		trusted, well developed, well understood systems that provide what they 
		want and enable them to help patients, with distrusted, less well 
		developed, less well understood systems that may end up costing 
		taxpayers a fortune without delivering what is required. </p>
