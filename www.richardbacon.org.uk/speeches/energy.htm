		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in the chamber of the 
			House of Commons as part of the debate on the Home Energy 
			Conservation Bill, on
			30 November 2001</cite></div>
		&nbsp;<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk): </b> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for 
		Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), who is a near neighbour of mine in South 
		Norfolk. This is my first opportunity to contribute to a debate on a 
		private Member's Bill, and I share the widely expressed sentiment that 
		such debates show the House of Commons at its best. It is my belief that 
		the House of Commons can mean something if the Members determine that it 
		should do so. I congratulate the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. 
		Turner) on securing this debate, and on having put it to such good use.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In addition to 
		Norwich city council, my own local authority, South Norfolk council, has 
		also expressed an interest in the Bill and asked me to support it, which 
		I am pleased to do. I listened with interest to the point made by my 
		hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) - who is no 
		longer in his place - about castigating the Government for not having 
		taken action earlier. He may have a point, but I would sooner 
		congratulate the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown on having taken this 
		opportunity to do something. This bears out my belief that we would 
		probably be better off if we had less Government legislation and more 
		private Member's legislation. It is, therefore, a great pleasure to 
		speak in this debate. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">On energy 
		conservation, there are clearly wide disparities in the energy 
		efficiency achieved by different local authorities. I have no doubt that 
		making the achievement of the targets mandatory will focus minds and 
		will assist the local authority officers responsible for achieving the 
		targets in negotiating for resources and delivering what they are 
		required to deliver. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Some 20 years ago, I 
		lived in Canada for a while. That is a country with a much colder 
		climate than this one. Day after day and week after week, the 
		temperature was regularly minus 35 deg Celsius. The hon. Member for 
		Norwich, North will know that by the time it gets down to minus 40 deg, 
		it does not matter whether it is Celsius or Fahrenheit. When I was 
		living there, the Canadian federal Government had a scheme for home 
		insulation that was extremely easy to access, extremely widely taken up 
		and had a huge impact on the levels of home insulation. This relates to 
		something that the hon. Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey) said 
		about the difficulty of getting grants. If the Bill becomes law, as I 
		hope and believe it will, I hope that the Government will consider 
		seriously what might be done to improve energy conservation through 
		encouraging much more uptake of home insulation. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">There is universal 
		agreement in the House that it is extraordinary that we are still 
		talking about fuel poverty, and any measures that can be taken to 
		eradicate it are welcome. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I shall not repeat 
		the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) 
		about houses in multiple occupation. He mentioned Conservative Future, 
		which is a splendid organisation with 10,000 vibrant young people who 
		can see which way things are going in the future. It is full of people 
		who recognise that the thing to do with stock is to buy it when it is 
		cheap. They have obviously backed the right horse in that respect. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Conservative Future 
		makes a valid point. When I was a student and first moved to London, I 
		lived in a house in multiple occupation. I was frightened of getting up 
		in the morning because it was so cold. Houses in multiple occupation 
		that lack proper facilities for warmth affect most those who are least 
		able to care for themselves at both ends of the spectrum: young people 
		who have left home and are just starting out or are in tertiary 
		education, and old people who spend most of their time at home and have 
		the most limited incomes. Any measures to deal with fuel poverty will 
		therefore be welcome. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I have a couple of 
		concerns. The first relates to the definition of multiple occupancy. I 
		shall not go into any detail, as that is a matter for the Committee, 
		which should give it close consideration. Any definition that 
		is agreed on when the Bill comes out of Committee should not create more 
		problems than it solves. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">My second concern 
		relates to registered social landlords and the point raised by my hon. 
		Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale), who has apologised to me 
		because he has had to leave the Chamber temporarily. I agree with the 
		hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown that good landlords have nothing to 
		fear from the Bill. I am sure that that is right. As my hon. Friend 
		said, many landlords will welcome the Bill. </p>
		<b>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Love: </b>Taking 
		a slightly wider view, there is a recognised need for institutional 
		investment in the private rented sector to deal with these problems. The 
		institutions are scared off by the Rachman-like image of the private 
		rented sector. The Bill will be the first step in attracting 
		institutional investment to deal with the problems. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>The hon. Gentleman 
		is almost certainly right. When I left university my first job was in a 
		merchant bank, and I was able to afford a warm flat in London. I had an 
		inglorious three years of merchant banking, where I worked longer hours 
		than in this place. What struck me most about my early experiences was 
		the extraordinary concern that people working in reputable institutions 
		in the City expressed about the probity of the organisations with which 
		they were dealing. That was at the time of the Guinness and other 
		scandals in the 1980s. It shocked me that, far from being swashbuckling 
		corporate financiers, institutions were hugely concerned to look for and 
		ensure probity on the part of those with whom they were dealing. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Simmonds: </b>
		Does my hon. Friend think that the classification of HMOs and specific 
		properties may deter some institutional investors from coming into the 
		market because of their derogatory perception of HMOs in the residential 
		marketplace? </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. </b><strong>
		Bacon</strong><b>: </b>The precise 
		definitions are matters for the Committee. My hon. Friend may also have 
		a point. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The key issue is that 
		most landlords most of the time are good and honourable and want to do 
		the right thing. A small minority are determined not to do the right 
		thing if at all possible. I shall not dwell on the definition, but it is 
		important. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">As I said, my second 
		concern relates to landlords. We should ensure that the regulatory 
		burden is not excessive when the Bill comes into force. That depends on 
		what is written in the Bill, and on how local authorities interpret and 
		act on the regulations. Resources should be disproportionately 
		concentrated on hunting down the relatively small proportion of bad 
		landlords. We should ensure that the majority of landlords who are keen 
		to fulfil their obligations do not feel that they are being hounded or 
		are not welcome. We must also ensure that the Bill does nothing to 
		reduce overall provision by the private rented sector, which needs to 
		expand, not contract. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I support the Bill, 
		and congratulate its promoter.<br>
