		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given as part of a debate in 
			the House of Commons on 15 October 2003.</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk)</b>: I shall try to be brief, as I know that other 
		Members wish to speak. Our motion states that we believe that the 
		Government are seeking to achieve their aims </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;through a burdensome and ineffective 
				bureaucracy&quot;, </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">a phrase that the 
		Government amendment seeks to strike out. In listening to this debate, I 
		have been struck by the fact that most contributors, including our own 
		Front Benchers and the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) - he now 
		speaks on these matters - have made it clear that the situation is 
		burdensome. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman used such phrases several times, 
		yet he has been in his job for only 24 hours. I should 
		like to hear the Minister acknowledge that the police still face an 
		excessive burden. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I went out on patrol 
		with the Norfolk constabulary a few months ago, and before doing so I 
		visited the new headquarters, which is in my constituency, and the local 
		Wymondham police station. The officers there showed me all the forms 
		that they have to fill out; indeed, they spread them out over a huge 
		conference table, which the forms more or less covered. <i>
		[Interruption.]</i> I see that the Minister is writing this down, and I 
		can tell her that the forms were supplied not by Norfolk constabulary 
		but from the centre, and that local officers were forced to comply with 
		them. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">If the Minister does 
		not believe that the system is now too burdensome and bureaucratic, 
		perhaps she will take the word of the chief constable of the Norfolk 
		constabulary. His report of 26 August to the Norfolk police authority 
		enumerates the problems that the police have been facing. We are 
		familiar with the problems that many police forces have had to absorb: 
		additional tasks in support of, or compliance with, extra initiatives, 
		legislation and processes, including best value; data collection for 
		performance indicators; efficiency planning; annual reports; performance 
		planning; consultation; activity-based costing; and various legislation, 
		including the Human Rights Act 1998, the working time directive, and 
		legislation on information and security, and on freedom of information. 
		There are also the diversity issues that constabularies now have to 
		contend with, the implementation of the recommendations of the Climbié 
		report, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, equal opportunities 
		provisions, the implementation of the Police Reform Act 2002, and so on. 
		Those, of course, impose extra burdens as well as extra costs, but there 
		is the additional problem of the funding process itself, which imposes 
		still further costs. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The chief constable 
		of Norfolk expressed in his report to the police authority the 
		constabulary's concern that Government policy </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;seems to provide funding more and more by 
				discrete ring-fenced packages rather than through the general 
				formula, often on a bidding basis which is competitive between 
				Forces. This causes a great deal of work on the part of 
				individual Forces, often at short notice and with the prospect 
				that this work may not result in funding being allocated and may 
				therefore be nugatory. Even when bids are successful, a huge 
				bureaucratic process is attached to grant claims, monitoring and 
				reporting expenditure, and auditing, and, typically, the 
				long-term continuation of ring-fenced funding streams is not 
				guaranteed.&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">I know that the 
		Minister said recently that she would like to see, where possible, a 
		reduction in the amount of ring-fenced grants, and I urge her to take 
		that commitment seriously. Where such funding is necessary, it should be 
		as clearly defined as possible and requirements should be given to 
		constabularies as early as possible. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Even if the 
		Government believe that they are doing their best, I would like them to 
		acknowledge that there is still a long way to go in reducing burdens on 
		the police. I quote again from the chief constable's report, which said 
		that police staff were </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;being subjected to an increasing burden 
				of form-filling, paperwork and bureaucracy arising from numerous 
				statutory and other initiatives, target-setting and performance 
				monitoring that is significantly diverting resources from 
				front-line policing.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">He was talking about 
		August this year, and continued: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;We accept that the police service must be 
				fully accountable and open to scrutiny but we feel that the 
				balance has tilted too far in one direction.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">I would like the 
		Government to acknowledge that the balance has indeed tilted too far in 
		one direction. Much more radical action is necessary to tilt that 
		balance back in the other direction and I hope that the Minister will 
		confirm that in her response tonight. <br>
