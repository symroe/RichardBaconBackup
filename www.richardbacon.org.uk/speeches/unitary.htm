		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given as part of an 
			Adjournment Debate in Westminster Hall on 20 November 2007.</cite></div>
		&nbsp;<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>
			<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</strong> It is 
			a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for North-West 
			Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham). I shall take up where he left off on the 
			theme of change, because it seems to me that the proposals are just 
			the latest example of an insatiable desire that affects all 
			Governments to engage in fiddling and changing things. I shall 
			examine that theme generically and discuss the lessons that can be 
			learned for Norfolk.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Wherever proponents of change are found&#8212;in the 
			private or public sectors&#8212;it can be useful to look at how the same 
			issues emerge, the same dramatis personae take to the stage, and the 
			same stratagems are employed to achieve change despite strong and 
			often compelling arguments against it. That applies in activities as 
			apparently diverse as mergers and acquisitions of commercial 
			companies and in delivery of changes in the adult education system 
			or in the tax and credit system&#8212;to take two examples purely at 
			random. I do not know why the Minister smiles, because the record 
			shows that a lot can be learned in both of those areas. He should 
			know that better than most, but I shall not dwell on that subject. 
			The delivery of new computer systems is another such activity, as 
			are private finance initiatives and the conversion of mutual 
			building societies into banks.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr. Bill Olner (in the Chair):</strong> Order. The hon. 
			Gentleman is not discussing local government in Norfolk.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr. Bacon:</strong> Thank you, Mr. Olner. I was about 
			to mention the reorganisation of local government. Whichever 
			activity is under discussion, the proposed changes usually have 
			certain common features. The benefits of the change are often 
			questionable and unproven. It is worth saying at this point that one 
			is not opposed to all change, in all circumstances, all the time. 
			Nevertheless, the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) 
			correctly articulated the Conservative position, which is that, if 
			change is not absolutely necessary, it is necessary not to 
			change&#8212;not least because change can itself bring all kinds of 
			unpredictable and undesirable consequences in its wake.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr. Charles Clarke:</strong> Does the hon. Gentleman 
			accept that nevertheless, for my constituents in Norwich, South, it 
			is indeed absolutely imperative to change, for the reasons that I 
			set out?</p>
			Mr. Bacon: </b>Not necessarily. The first thing 
			that the citizens of Norwich need is a council that can look after 
			their money properly, rather than one that, as the Audit Commission 
			has said, is not fit for purpose. Once the council has got its basic 
			management sorted out, it could think about other things, but it 
			should put the tasks in the right order first. However, let me 
			repeat that my party is not opposed to change in all circumstances.<b>
			<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr. Keith Simpson: </strong>My hon. Friend may not be 
			aware of an article that was published in September in the <i>
			Eastern Daily Press</i> in which the right hon. Member for Norwich, 
			South (Mr. Clarke) put forward his arguments in favour of unitary 
			authorities. It illustrates the very point made by my hon. Friend. 
			The right hon. Gentleman was quoted as saying:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20.0pt">&#8220;I think the 
			position of the city council to reject a £20m investment in one of 
			the areas of greatest need is educationally ignorant and 
			particularly backward-looking.</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20.0pt">You have to 
			question the seriousness of the city&#8217;s unitary bid. People will look 
			at the position the city council has taken and think&#8212;what is it 
			doing turning £20m down?&#8221;</p>
			<p class="speechbody">His assessment of his own city council is 
			pretty abysmal, therefore.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr. Bacon: </strong>My hon. Friend makes the point very 
			eloquently. As I was saying, a number of common themes emerge. One 
			is the theme of huge financial costs, which are usually much larger 
			than originally stated. Another is the presence of characters who 
			stand to benefit from change whether or not the wider interests of 
			the organisation and of its customers are served. Last is that of a 
			jargon or patter that, at least superficially and on first hearing, 
			makes what sounds like a convincing case for change.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">It is no coincidence, therefore, that the 
			proponents of change often adopt the same approach, in which the 
			first tactic is to overstate the benefits. For example, most GPs say 
			that it would have been better not to have proceeded with the NHS IT 
			system, even though it promised huge benefits. Another example is 
			that of mergers and acquisitions, most of which fail&#8212;although loads 
			of people make money from them.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">The second tactic is to understate the risks 
			and costs. The Minister knows all about that from the example of 
			individual learning accounts, which I mentioned earlier. And who 
			would now doubt, despite the benefits that were touted at the time 
			of demutualisation, that Northern Rock would have been better off 
			had it remained a mutual building society rather than converting to 
			a bank?</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Another important tactic is to act very fast 
			so that there is little time for those who doubt the wisdom of the 
			proposal to examine the case against it. A good example of that is 
			the tax credits mess, in which the timetable for testing whether it 
			would work was compressed almost to the point of extinction. Many 
			hon. Members have seen the results of that in their constituencies.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I am tempted to say that another common theme 
			is emerging in cases in which there has been a mess: the presence of 
			the Minister. I shall not say that, however, because it would do him 
			a disservice. He was a Treasury Minister for many years, and I am 
			told that once one puts on a Treasury hat one can never entirely 
			take it off. I am hoping, therefore, that he will view the proposals 
			with a very jaundiced eye&#8212;not because change is always bad, but 
			because one should make the case for it stack up, which nobody has 
			yet convincingly done.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">The people who benefit from change go by 
			different names. Sometimes, they are called merchant bankers and 
			lawyers. They look for transaction fees. Sometimes, they are called 
			chief executives&#8212;a phenomenon that is common to both the public and 
			private sectors. On occasions, they stand to receive an enormous 
			pay-off if they lose their positions, and so face the enticing 
			prospect of financial independence for many years to come without 
			the inconvenience of actually having to work. Sometimes, the people 
			benefiting are called professors of local government, who receive 
			commission for writing long and important reports. The people who 
			lose are often the same, although with different names: council tax 
			payers, shareholders or people who want their garbage collected once 
			a week and find that that is not possible.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">The last category is the cadre of professional 
			explainers or witch doctors who explain how marvellous everything is 
			going to be. Sometimes they are called PFI consultants; <br>
			sometimes they are called financial PR consultants&#8212;I should declare 
			an interest in that regard&#8212;and sometimes they are called Ministers. 
			The key is to develop a convincing patter. Plausible examples are 
			needed of how silly the present system is. An example might be that 
			parish councils cut the grass, but district councils clean the 
			pavements or county councils clean the roads. It might be that 
			district councils collect waste but county councils dispose of it, 
			or that counties deal with social services, whereas districts deal 
			with housing.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">The essential point about all these examples 
			is that the proposals&#8212;if one can call them proposals in the absence 
			of terms of reference&#8212;for local government change in Norfolk exhibit 
			all these characteristics. The benefits are entirely theoretical. We 
			can have a debate about the benefits, but as the hon. Member for 
			North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) said, they are benefits on paper. We 
			have had loads of experience in this respect. If 25 reorganisations 
			of the national health service since 1982 have taught us anything, 
			it should be that organisational tinkering must be treated with 
			great caution.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">There are enormous risks. The creation of, 
			say, four social services departments where there is currently one 
			involves enormous risks. There is the potential nightmare of 
			organisational change, with vulnerable children&#8212;goodness knows, we 
			have had experience of that issue in Norfolk&#8212;falling through the 
			gaps in the new organogram, at a time when we have barely digested 
			the changes caused by the merger of educational and social services 
			for children into a new department.</p><p class="speechbody">The cost estimates vary, but they have been 
			put conservatively at £100 million. I should like to know where that 
			money is coming from. We have just had a very tight settlement 
			through the comprehensive spending review. Why should the poor 
			council tax payer stump up for what are at best theoretical 
			benefits? For that matter, why should the central Government 
			taxpayer stump up&#8212;after all, they are mostly the same people&#8212;when 
			there are so many better things, as the hon. Member for North 
			Norfolk pointed out, on which we desperately need to spend money?</p>
			<p class="speechbody">In any case, those are conservative estimates. 
			By how much will we see the costs explode? The largest component of 
			the reorganisation of the police service in Norfolk, Suffolk and 
			Cambridgeshire proposed by the right hon. Member for Norwich, 
			South&#8212;the cost was £88 million&#8212;was merging the IT, at a time when 
			people were saying that they wanted more police officers. How much 
			will it actually cost to merge the IT of the different local 
			authorities in Norfolk? No matter which proposal is chosen, we have 
			to have the status quo as an option.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Of course there are characters around who 
			stand to benefit from the process of change, whether the wider 
			interests of the organisation and its customers are served or not. 
			If we had several unitary councils, there would be several new 
			social services directors, education directors&#8212;call them what you 
			will; even with the merger of children&#8217;s services, there would be 
			new senior staff&#8212;and directors of planning and transportation. My 
			hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) mentioned the 
			transformation director, on a stipend of £90,000. How much 
			transformation we get for 90,000 quid remains to be seen. The answer 
			is probably not much. If, however, we have a unitary council, there 
			will be a number of highly paid officers taking enormous redundancy 
			packages, as we have already seen in relation to primary care.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Once again, we have seen the tactic of acting 
			very fast so that there is little time for those who doubt the 
			wisdom of the proposal to examine the case. The chairman of the 
			boundary committee is going around prejudging what form of 
			government will emerge from the process in a way that is possibly 
			unlawful, as we have heard, and certainly dangerous for democracy 
			and consultation. Astonishingly, councils are expected to provide 
			intelligent answers on local government reorganisation when they 
			have not even been told what the question is.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Finally, a jargon or patter is needed that 
			will at least superficially, on first hearing, make what sounds like 
			a convincing case for change. Fortunately, that is not my job. I 
			await a reply from the Minister, but I remain to be convinced.</p>
