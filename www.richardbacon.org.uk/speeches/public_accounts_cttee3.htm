		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in 
			the House of Commons on
			24 January 2002</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk):</b> As the hon. 
		Member for Croydon, Central (Geraint Davies) concluded his speech, I 
		thought I heard the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) say that the 
		debate still had three or four hours to run. I read the speech that the 
		hon. Member for Newbury made in the previous debate, and I note that he 
		began his remarks by saying that he was conscious that no one else was 
		seeking to catch Mr. Speaker's eye. I therefore came prepared with lots 
		of documents, not least because I know that my hon. Friend the Member 
		for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) finds it amusing when I quote from documents in 
		the Committee. Of course, I subscribe to the Fidel Castro view that if a 
		speech is less than four hours, it cannot do any good. However, I 
		suspect that I would try your patience, Madam Deputy Speaker, and that 
		of the House were I to go through all the documents that I have brought 
		with me. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">My hon. Friend the 
		Member for Tatton and I are at a disadvantage. As new Committee members, 
		we have not witnessed much of the work that is being debated today, so I 
		have decided to restrict myself to a couple of general themes that are 
		of enduring interest to the work of the Committee and the NAO, which I 
		shall illustrate with quotes from Committee and NAO reports. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I begin, however, by 
		joining other hon. Members in paying tribute to the work of the retiring 
		Committee Clerk, Mr. Ken Brown, who has been enormously helpful. I wish 
		his successor, Nicholas Wright, every success in his new job. He has 
		already been very helpful to Committee members. I also pay tribute to 
		the NAO, in particular to the work of its press office under the able 
		stewardship of Gabrielle Cohen and Keith Davis, both of whom have been 
		enormously helpful. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Committee's work 
		is of central importance. The act of this House of Commons taking money 
		from taxpayers by compulsion and forcing them to pay into the 
		consolidated fund - into the Exchequer - is a cardinal act. It is of central 
		importance that the House has that ability, but it is equally important 
		that having taken money from taxpayers, the way in which it is 
		safeguarded, looked after and spent is transparent, open and 
		accountable. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In the last debate on 
		public accounts, the then Financial Secretary said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;I conclude from the debate that the 
				Government need to focus on two matters. First we must continue 
				to improve the management of the systems by which public money 
				is collected and deployed. Secondly, we must continue to improve 
				the management of projects to deliver public services.&quot; [<i>Official 
				Report</i>, 14 December 2000; Vol. 359, c. 865.] </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">That sums up the 
		themes that I want to address. The first is that we need good 
		procurement. Central Government - the same applies to other forms of 
		government, such as local authorities and health authorities - have a role 
		in that. The public sector needs to understand procurement and to be a 
		good buyer. That is central to successful government. It is welcome that 
		the Office of Government Commerce is taking a greater role under its new 
		chief executive, Mr. Peter Gershon. He has appeared 
		before the Committee two or three times and is doing an excellent job in 
		persuading Departments of the importance of skill in procurement. I 
		sometimes think that he has an uphill struggle, but he is trying to make 
		it a priority in Departments. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">My second theme is 
		that of good project management, which the Financial Secretary also 
		mentioned. I would add good risk management to that, because they go 
		together. Risk has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members. No one on 
		the Committee is opposed to the public sector taking risks. It is, 
		however, a matter of understanding what the risks are and, having 
		identified them, ensuring that they are carefully managed. We all take a 
		risk when we walk out of the front door, but it is knowing that there 
		are risks and properly managing them that matters. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In the document 
		&quot;Working with Suppliers: The Code of Good Customer Practice&quot; the Office 
		of Government Commerce says: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Central civil government will work to a 
				high standard of professionalism when dealing with suppliers. It 
				will do this by&quot;, </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">among other things,
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;effectively managing risks during a 
				procurement process and working with suppliers to reduce risks 
				during the business relationship.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Both of those are 
		central considerations. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In that earlier 
		debate, the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love), who used to serve on 
		the Committee, referred to information technology projects. He could, 
		however, have been referring to any kind of project when he said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;We should recognise that they&quot; 
		-&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="speechbody">IT projects - </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;are not a marginal technical decision but 
		part of the mainstream business activity of departments, and 
			must be treated as such. We need to manage to staff in a way 
				that is appropriate for a project. We must provide training and 
				incentives to keep the staff with the project while it is 
				introduced. The status of staff, especially in the public 
				sector, must be appropriate to their responsibilities. Most 
				important, staff must be accountable, not only for their 
				success, but for any failures.&quot; [<i>Official Report</i>, 14 
				December 2000; Vol. 359, c. 854.] </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">When Mr. Gershon 
		from the Office of Government Commerce came before the Committee, we 
		discussed civil service culture, the approach to the management of staff 
		and the attitudes of staff. I was interested to know whether he thought 
		that the way in which the civil service moves staff around, which is 
		inherent in its culture although not in that of the private sector, is 
		fundamentally inimical to successful project management. Mr. Gershon 
		agreed. He said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;In my experience of private sector 
				organisation, yes of course they want to appoint the best people 
				to the job, but they also want the project to be completed 
				successfully . . . and some say, 'No, we need to promote that 
				man in situ because he is critical to the project, we need to 
				keep him in place, but he should not suffer financially or 
				careerwise as a result'&quot;. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">He had spent 30 
		years in the private sector, and in his limited experience of the public 
		sector he saw less of that approach in the civil service, for good and 
		understandable reasons. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Gershon went on, 
		however: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;But as there is an increased focus on the 
				successful delivery agenda, there is a question of whether we 
				need to put in place mechanisms that might help retain key 
				people in key jobs, and something ought to be done about 
				succession planning so that if someone does move for legitimate 
				career reasons, there is someone to backfill in.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That brings me to 
		the point that I raised with the hon. Member for Newbury, which is that 
		the public sector does not seem to have taken that approach on board.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The NAO issued a 
		report on the implementation of the National Probation Service 
		information systems strategy. The project overran its budget by about 70 
		per cent. and ended up costing £118 million, which was about £50 million 
		more than it should have cost. That project had seven project directors 
		in seven years, which was fundamentally the fault of the project 
		managers, not of the suppliers. As my hon. Friend the Member for 
		Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) said, project management is central. It is time 
		that that was more widely understood and acted on in Whitehall. 
		Successful project managers need to move to senior leadership and senior 
		management positions in Whitehall to a greater extent. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Some years ago, the 
		Cabinet Office published a report on the use of consultants in the 
		public sector. In a previous incarnation, I used to work for the 
		consulting industry and came to know the report rather well. On page 59, 
		it points out: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;In most effective organisations, 
				management skills are high and they manage consultancy projects 
				very tightly.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Again, just as it 
		was possible to delete the reference to &quot;IT&quot; from my earlier quotation, 
		it is possible to delete the word &quot;consultancy&quot; from this one and still 
		be left with the idea that it is cardinally important to manage projects 
		tightly. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The report went on:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;To maximise ownership and accountability 
				the same individual, where possible, will often see the project 
				through from inception to implementation.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">I think that the 
		Government are alive to that approach, but it is a case of promulgating 
		it through the Departments and making sure that people act on it. It is 
		essential that the Government understand the central importance of 
		project management in what they do rather than in what they say. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In the short time 
		that I have been on the Committee, it has dealt with the loss to the 
		Revenue from fraud on alcohol duty, which amounted to £858 million, the 
		loss of £48 million as a result of the project for the National 
		Probation Service and the collection of the benefit payment card 
		cancellation, which cost more than £1 billion. That is nearly £2 
		billion, equivalent to nearly 1p on income tax. It is right for us as 
		elected representatives to ask how much hard work had to go in to earn 
		the money to pay the £2 billion of tax to the Exchequer which was then 
		wasted. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The subject of risk 
		management is closely tied up with that of project management. Paragraph 
		(iii) of page 1 of the Committee's report, &quot;Managing Risk in Government 
		Departments states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Risk management will only become a normal 
				and integral part of the way departments and agencies operate if 
				civil servants have the skills to identify and assess risks and 
				take the action necessary to manage them.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">The hon. Member for 
		City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) pointed out the need to ensure that civil 
		servants have the skills to identify risks. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The recent closure 
		of individual learning accounts, which was alluded to earlier in the 
		debate, raises the question: where was the risk management? We might ask
		where was the understanding, even, that any risks 
		were involved. I sat through the proceedings of the Education and Skills 
		Committee yesterday morning and listened to the evidence of officials. 
		The Committee was concerned about the apparent absence of any 
		recognition that there were serious risks that needed to be managed. The 
		Audit Commission published a report called &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;, on 
		the need to watch out for computer fraud in the public sector, and found 
		that, again, the question of risk management appeared to have been 
		completely ignored. 
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">My next point 
		concerns where the Committee should begin to focus its attention in 
		future. According to a newspaper report in December, fraud and waste 
		cost the NHS between £7 billion and £10 billion a year. I asked the 
		chief executive of the NHS about that last week when he came before the 
		Committee to talk about the report on inappropriate adjustments to 
		waiting lists. I recently received the transcript of the proceedings 
		from the Committee Clerks, and the stenographer had typed the figures as 
		£7 million and £10 million. I corrected them to billions, and then I 
		thought that I had better attach a note to say that the figures should 
		be in billions because the sums are so huge that people would think that 
		I was not serious. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Seven to ten 
		thousand million pounds is enough to pay for between 30 and 43 hospitals 
		like the recently completed Norfolk and Norwich hospital. In fact, that 
		hospital is still being built, but patients are moving into it. It is a 
		PFI project on the borders of my constituency. I mention in parentheses 
		that no one bothered to build a road to the hospital, so it is difficult 
		to get to even though it is consuming £229 million of public money. My 
		point is that between £7 billion and £10 billion goes south every year 
		in the NHS, and if that estimate is not correct, we need to get to the 
		bottom of it. Those losses have been happening for years, and the matter 
		needs much closer attention than it currently appears to receive. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Department for 
		Social Security, now the Department for Work and Pensions, is another 
		area that needs the Committee's steady attention. Indeed, we shall soon 
		be looking at fraud in income support. I have before me the DSS 
		appropriation accounts, and I am looking at the page on which the CAG 
		sets out in a certificate his views on the accounts. Just as the 
		auditors of a private company sign off accounts, the CAG signs off the 
		DSS accounts, in this case to the House of Commons. He has qualified his 
		opinion of these accounts, saying: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;In my opinion, the appropriation account 
				properly presents the expenditure and receipts . . . except for 
				irregular expenditure arising from errors in benefit awards and 
				from fraudulent benefit claims&quot;. </p>
	<p class="speechbody">I tabled a 
		parliamentary question to the Department for Work and Pensions asking in 
		how many years since 1972 the DSS appropriation accounts had been 
		qualified in that way. I was a little concerned when the Department 
		phoned to ask me what was irregular expenditure, so I pointed to the 
		CAG's certificate and said that that was precisely the term that he had 
		used. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">If one looks at the 
		itemisation of that irregular expenditure, one finds that the DSS 
		estimates that losses through error and fraud for income support and 
		jobseeker's allowance in 1999-2000 were £1.32 billion, and in 1998-1999 
		the CAG noted that the Department had estimated that the combined level 
		of fraud on income support and jobseeker's allowance could have been as 
		high as £1.53 billion. Those are huge sums. If one considers only the health service and the DWP, one 
		finds that huge sums are disappearing without the NAO being able to 
		identify where they have gone because the Government are not managing 
		the situation closely enough. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I share the concern 
		expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and 
		Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) that in recent years the Committee has spent 
		about 4 per cent. of its time examining the accounts of the royal 
		household. Although it is entirely appropriate that the royal household, 
		which is the subject of great interest, is transparent, open and 
		accountable and that its accounts are examined by the House, we should 
		concentrate on going after the billions before we worry about the £5 
		million spent by the royal household. In any case, that figure is a 
		reduction because the household is being extremely well managed, as was 
		made clear in the evidence that we heard last week. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The final matter 
		that I want to mention is less significant in macro-financial terms, but 
		it is none the less of huge importance for many people. I refer to the 
		sources of public funding for students. The NAO has recently produced a 
		report on the subject, &quot;Improving Student Achievement in Higher 
		Education&quot;, on which we will shortly take evidence from the permanent 
		secretary at the Department for Education and Skills. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The report contains 
		an interesting chart that shows the 23 different sources of public 
		funding from which students may seek support. The system is 
		extraordinarily complex; for example, single parents who want a child 
		care grant go to one source and those who are eligible for school meals 
		grants go to another. One practically needs a PhD simply to understand 
		the method of obtaining student support. I have raised the matter with 
		the NAO, and I continue to encourage it to examine it. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The complexity of 
		the system has direct implications for the economy, effectiveness and 
		efficiency with which public money is deployed for student support. On 
		the two occasions on which tranches of the student loan book were sold, 
		it was at a very large discount to face value. The reason is that the 
		quality of the student loan book is not very high - a lot of the debt is 
		not repaid. As a result, the market requires a high discount before it 
		will buy the debt. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">As I said, last year 
		the then Financial Secretary alluded at the end of his speech to the 
		importance of focusing on collection systems as well as on systems for 
		deploying public expenditure. If we could find a more economical, 
		effective and efficient system for collecting the moneys that students 
		owe, and there are many possible models, we would do a great service to 
		the taxpayer but, equally importantly, make it much easier for students 
		from disadvantaged backgrounds to go on to higher education. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Talking to people in 
		my constituency on the doorstep and elsewhere has left me without the 
		slightest doubt - I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House 
		have had the same experience - that the extraordinary complexity of the 
		student loan system has a big deterrent effect on a certain stratum of 
		potential students who are on the cusp of deciding whether to go to 
		university. That decision is as important for people from well-off 
		backgrounds, but it is extraordinarily important to those who have not 
		been used to getting into debt or who are from families in which no one 
		has ever been to university. I hope that the NAO will take the issue 
		seriously in future. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In conclusion, I 
		would just like to say what a privilege it is to serve on the Committee. 
		As a new Member I still have a lot to learn, but I have been thoroughly 
		enjoying the Committee's work. I believe that it plays an absolutely 
		central role in ensuring that the money that we take from taxpayers is 
		accounted for in an open and transparent fashion. The House of Commons, 
		in sanctioning the Committee, is doing a very fine job.</p>
