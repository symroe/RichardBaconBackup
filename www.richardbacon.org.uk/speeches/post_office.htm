			<p class="asublist"><i>This speech was given during a debate on rural post offices on 24 March 2004</i><br>
&nbsp;</div>
		<b>Richard Bacon (South Norfolk)</b> (Con): The motion refers to
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;the significant role played by local post 
				offices in both rural and urban areas&quot;. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">My hon. Friend the 
		Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) has told us about the situation in 
		rural areas, and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard 
		Burden) made a thoughtful speech about the situation in south 
		Birmingham. Like my hon. Friend, I wish to concentrate on rural areas, 
		and in doing so, talk about the problem facing people in Norfolk because 
		of Powergen's actions, which my right hon. Friend the Member for 
		South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard) mentioned briefly in an intervention.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">People sometimes 
		underestimate just how different things are in rural areas compared with 
		urban areas. My constituency covers 350 square miles: Greater London, 
		which contains 74 parliamentary constituencies, covers 650 square miles. 
		My constituency is more than half the size of Greater London. My right 
		hon. Friend, whose constituency neighbours mine, has a constituency some 
		three times the size of mine—at about 1,100 square miles, I think. Post 
		offices in rural areas are part of the social fabric of local 
		communities, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield acknowledged 
		when he was dealing with urban areas. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mrs. Shephard</b>:<b> </b>I 
		thank my hon. Friend for referring to the entirely different problems 
		faced by people in far-flung rural areas. I have a letter from the 
		postmaster at Banham in my constituency, who says that as a result of 
		Powergen's decisions, residents will now have to travel nine miles to 
		the nearest pay-point outlet and nine miles back. For many elderly, 
		disabled or less well-off people, that is not an option. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon</b>: I 
		agree with my right hon. Friend. Such a journey is not an option for 
		many people. That is why I have taken up the issue with Powergen and 
		with the Post Office, to ask whether they can renegotiate. Indeed, I 
		have also taken it up with Ofgem, to see whether it thinks that Powergen 
		is acting against the public interest. I, too, represent constituents 
		who will have to travel some distance to get electricity swipe cards 
		topped up - to a neighbouring market town, in this case, as a result of Powergen's decision to withdraw the contract from the Post Office. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">People in Roydon in 
		my constituency, some of whom are on limited incomes and do not have 
		cars, can knock on the doors and Mr. and Mrs. West will open up after 
		hours, even at 9.30 at night, so that a young mother with two children 
		who has suddenly run out of electricity can be reconnected. Effectively, 
		that is a social service, and there seems to be no reason why Powergen 
		should unilaterally remove the contract from the Post Office. </p>
		<b>
		</b>
		<p class="speechbody">I received from 
		Powergen a letter of the sort that we all receive from time to time, 
		explaining how it was enhancing its service. There is a German word, 
		&quot;Verschlimmbesserung&quot;, which, loosely translated, means the process by 
		which, as things are improved, they get worse. We are familiar with that 
		process from many different aspects of life, and it is certainly 
		applicable in this case. I look forward to receiving a sensible reply 
		from Powergen and hearing about a reconsideration of this ill-considered 
		and ill-thought-out policy.</p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Stephen O'Brien</b>: Is my hon. Friend aware 
		of another relevant German expression that is difficult to translate 
		into any other language? What is happening displays that Powergen has 
		anything other than &quot;Fingerspitzengefühl&quot; - a fingertip feel. </p>
		<b>
		<p class="speechbody"><strong>Mr. Bacon</strong>:
		</b>I am aware of that expression; my hon. Friend makes a good point, 
		and Powergen needs to reconsider the issue with some care. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The second issue that 
		I want to raise involves a specific problem that arose some three years 
		ago because of the decision of Mrs. Rogers, the then sub-postmistress at 
		Coldham Green, Deopham, to retire from running the post office in Pie 
		Lane. As she was retiring, she requested that the post box in her front 
		garden be taken away. Indeed, the parish council suggested that the box 
		should be resited somewhere else, which seemed perfectly reasonable. It 
		also seemed reasonable that Mrs. Rogers should no longer have a post box 
		in her front garden when she was no longer running the post office. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The problem that 
		subsequently arose has endured for so long because of Royal Mail's 
		failure locally - I stress the word &quot;locally&quot; - to understand, recognise or 
		acknowledge the difference between resiting and removing. Thus, the 
		local Royal Mail manager's response to concerned local residents, to the 
		parish council and to me has been to ask why residents of Coldham Green 
		should have an additional post box. In fact, all that local residents 
		are asking for is the relocation of a previously existing box in a 
		slightly different place. The local Royal Mail manager has gone so far 
		as to allege that there is a post box in a place where there is none.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I have gone to the 
		chief executive and chairman of Royal Mail, who have been helpful, and I 
		look forward to receiving a sensible response. I have walked the route 
		that people must now take, and I can see how dangerous it is. Without a 
		post box in their area, local people must walk to the other end of the 
		village down a road that has a 60 mph speed limit—although it certainly 
		should have a lower limit. Young mothers with prams must push their 
		small children down the lane to the post box at the other end of the 
		village, but there is no verge and there is nowhere for them to hide. 
		That is not a practical option, and many people refuse to take it and 
		are thus deprived of a service. I hope to get a sensible answer out of 
		Royal Mail in due course, and also some indication that it will 
		encourage its local managers to take a slightly more helpful and 
		interested approach. Postwatch is also escalating the priority attached 
		to the local complaint, and I hope that there will be a resolution. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">As for the so-called 
		neutral position on the Post Office card account, a number of hon. 
		Members have referred to the apparent difference between what we, and 
		our constituents, are experiencing in our daily lives 
		and what is happening over there on Planet Hewitt, where there seems to 
		be no difference between the treatment of the options on offer, and they 
		are apparently being laid out in a neutral way. How can Age Concern, 
		Citizens Advice, the National Consumer Council, the National Federation 
		of Sub-Postmasters, the Communication Workers Union and the National 
		Federation of Women's Institutes all have expressed concern about the 
		obstacles and difficulties in opening a Post Office card account, yet 
		the Government and Ministers on Planet Hewitt do not seem to think that 
		there is a problem? The Minister should be careful before he takes on 
		the National Federation of Women's Institutes. He should recall what 
		happened to his boss when he tried to do that. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">It is absolutely 
		clear that there is an issue. Indeed, the guidance given to Department 
		for Work and Pensions staff, contains this statement: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;We need to pay most of these customers 
				into bank accounts which cost 1p, rather than into Post Office 
				card accounts, which cost up to 30 times more. You should be 
				aiming to get nine out of 10 new claimants into bank accounts, 
				with a small proportion paid through Post Office card accounts.&quot;
				</p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That does not sound 
		very neutral to me. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">That prompts another 
		question. Quite apart from the fact that there is not the neutrality 
		that the Government allege, why should the card accounts cost so much 
		more than bank accounts? After all, lottery terminals have been put into 
		convenience stores, post offices and small shops throughout the country. 
		The proposed payment system is relatively simple, and ought not to cost 
		30 times more than bank accounts. If one looked into the problem, I 
		suspect that one would discover that, as is often the case with 
		Government IT projects, the Government's IT advice has cost more than it 
		should. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">As hon. Members, 
		including my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), who 
		introduced the debate, have said, the key issue is choice. 
		Theoretically, at least, the Government are in favour in choice. Indeed, 
		the Prime Minister's Office of Public Services Reform, in the pamphlet, 
		&quot;Principles into Practice&quot;, published in March 2002, said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Choice acknowledges that consumers of 
		public services should increasingly be given the kind of options 
		that they take for granted in other walks of life.&quot; </p>
				<p class="speechbody">Amen to that. The 
		Government should back up their rhetoric and give our constituents in 
		both urban and rural areas the kind of choice that they expect. <br>
