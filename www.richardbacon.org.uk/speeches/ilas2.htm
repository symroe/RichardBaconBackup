		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given as part of a debate in 
			the House of Commons, on 27 June 2002</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		<b>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk):</b> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for 
		Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis). I agreed with just about 
		everything he said. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I congratulate the 
		hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) and his colleagues on a 
		sensationally good report, produced at amazing speed. I am not a member 
		of the Select Committee on Education and Skills, although as a member of 
		the Public Accounts Committee I sat in on some of its hearings, which I 
		considered to be a model for the way in which other Select Committees 
		should do their work. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The report contains 
		much that is worth mentioning, but I do not want to take up too much of 
		the House's time. Let me just quote a couple of quick headlines. 
		According to page 14, </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;It should have been possible to design a 
				scheme to encourage new providers that was not wide open to 
				fraud or abuse by unscrupulous people posing as learning 
				providers, but the lack of quality assurance made it almost 
				inevitable that it would be abused.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">The most 
		extraordinary thing perhaps is that there were timely warnings. Perhaps 
		most famously, Mr. James O'Brien of Pitman Training Group gave a warning 
		on 20 September 2000. In criticising the lack of detail in a letter to 
		the Secretary of State, he said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;As a responsible training provider we 
				were worried that this lack of detail left the scheme open to 
				abuse, which would not be helpful to either the initiative 
				itself, or the majority of the training sector.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">The report makes it 
		clear that it was not clear who was responsible. Paragraph 154 says: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;It is not clear who was responsible for 
				delivering the specific outcomes of the ILA project. There does 
				appear to have been some confusion of responsibilities.&quot; </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Paragraph 169 states 
		that the objectives were not clear: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;We are not convinced that the Government 
				had adequately clarified the precise educational and social 
				objectives of the ILA scheme . . . With a target fixed in terms 
				of the number of accounts . . . it was clear that the delivery 
				mechanism had become confused with the educational objective.&quot;
				</p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">I refer briefly to 
		the role of Capita, as other hon. Members have done. The report says on 
		page 16: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Surprisingly, the potential expertise of 
				Capita in designing systems to be fraud-resistant was neither 
				called upon, nor offered.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Later, paragraph 97 
		states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;We find it hard to credit that Capita, a 
				major player in winning contracts for work contracted out to the 
				private sector, should not have pointed out that, without a 
				quality threshold for providers, the ILA was a disaster waiting 
				to happen.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Capita is a major 
		player in a variety of aspects to do with public administration. It 
		provides advice and services to over 120 local authorities. It collects 
		£1 billion in council tax and business rates. It administrates the 
		teacher superannuation scheme, which has 1.2 million teachers and 
		400,000 teacher pensioners. It seems that there may be a role for the 
		National Audit Office, in addition to the report to which the hon. 
		Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) referred, in doing a study 
		specifically on Capita and its relationship with the public sector, both 
		at local and central Government levels. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">As a member of the 
		PAC, I am particularly concerned about the management, or rather the 
		lack of management, of financial resources. I say in passing that the 
		former Minister with responsibility for adult skills, who is now 
		Economic Secretary to the Treasury, has been helpful to me personally and I am sure to other hon. Members 
		in keeping me informed of progress, although there has not been as much 
		as one would have liked. One of the most shocking things that I heard 
		was in the evidence presented on 28 November last year, which is not in 
		the report, but which I have a transcript of from the internet. The hon. 
		Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) was probing the then 
		Minister and not getting very far. The Chairman intervened and said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Minister, what you are being asked by&quot;
				</p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">the hon. Member for 
		Chatham and Aylesford is </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;surely there must have been an estimate 
				of how much this would cost year on year, an estimate. He is 
				just asking what sort of level of overshoot is there . . . What 
				are the ballpark figures you are knocking around the Department 
				on this?&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">The then Minister 
		replied: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;At the moment because of the uncertain 
				number of individual learning account discount payments we are 
				going to have to pay we simply cannot give you a sense, even a 
				ballpark I regret to say, of what the possible overspends are 
				going to be.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">So there was no 
		control of cash whatever. There was no control of information 
		technology. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Audit Commission 
		report of February 1998 entitled, &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; says on the 
		front page: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;The overall position shows little 
				improvement . . . Frauds or cases of IT abuse often occur 
				because of the absence of basic controls, with one-half of all 
				detected frauds found by accident. Senior management still 
				appears to lack a commitment to improving IT security and 
				cracking down on abuse.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Why did no one in 
		the Department for Education and Skills take notice of that? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In relation to basic 
		project management and financial control, again, a very good report was 
		published by the Cabinet Office in August 1994. On page 60, at paragraph 
		4.42, it says; </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;A project plan is agreed to identify who 
				does what and ensure different contributions are brought 
				together effectively. It will set strict timetables, identify 
				interim deliverables . . . establish clear performance measures 
				. . . There will also be tight financial control throughout, 
				with expenditure closely monitored.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That was eight years 
		ago. Those are not new ideas; they are obvious, common-sense ideas, 
		which many people who work hard to pay the tax that the Government 
		sometimes waste would be able to come up with without too much 
		difficulty. It is not surprising, therefore, that page 11 of the report 
		reached the following conclusion: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;We regard the failure of the Department 
				for Education and Skills to learn from mistakes made in the past 
				by its predecessors and other Government Departments to be one 
				of the most disturbing aspects of the ILA experience.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">I conclude by 
		referring to the hugely important role of the accounting officer. If 
		permanent secretaries of Departments, who are accounting officers, are 
		not happy with the steps that Ministers propose to take, specific 
		provision is made within British Government to enable them to flag up 
		that fact. A document published by the Treasury in 2001, entitled &quot;The 
		Responsibilities of an Accounting Officer&quot;, establishes that, if a 
		course of action is being followed that a permanent secretary is unhappy 
		with, he can require the Minister to issue a ministerial direction, if 
		the Minister chooses to override the advice given. Paragraph 15 of the 
		document states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;If the Minister in charge of the 
				department is contemplating a course of action involving a 
				transaction which as Accounting Officer you consider would 
				infringe the requirements of propriety or regularity . . . you 
				should set out in writing your objection to the proposal, the reasons for your objection 
				and your duty to notify the Comptroller and Auditor General . . 
				. If the Minister decides nonetheless to proceed, you should 
				seek a written instruction to take the action in question. 
				Having received such an instruction, you must comply . . . but 
				should then inform the Treasury&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">and the National 
		Audit Office. If that has been done, </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;the PAC can be expected to recognise that 
				the Accounting Officer bears no personal responsibility for the 
				transaction.&quot; </p>
		<p class="speechbody">For a project with 
		at best confused policy objectives, and which was not properly planned 
		or implemented, one might have thought that a very good case existed for 
		seeking direction. I tabled a parliamentary question, asking what 
		directions had been given since 1997. The answer was that 14 were given: 
		one by the Department of Trade and Industry, one by the Northern Ireland 
		Court Service, one by the former Department for Transport, Local 
		Government and the Regions, three by the Export Credits Guarantee 
		Department, three by the Ministry of Defence, and - to no one's 
		surprise - five by the former Department of Social Security. However, from 
		the Department for Education and Skills there was a deafening silence. 
		The scheme ended up sticking a fire hose out of a window and spraying 
		taxpayers' money over anyone who happened to walk by. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">All hon. Members 
		will agree that the saddest thing is that this was such a good and noble 
		idea. During the 1988 Democratic national convention, Jesse Jackson 
		said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;I was born in the slum, but the slum was 
				not born in me. And it wasn't born in you, and you can make it.&quot;
				</p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That should have 
		been the message of this programme, but what kind of message is sent by 
		its absence for nearly a year? The message is, &quot;I was born in the slum, 
		but I'll remain in the slum and I cannot make it because the people who 
		should know better - the people who are paid to know better - cannot put in 
		place basic project management, basic information technology security 
		and basic financial controls.&quot; That is the sad saga. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I hope that the 
		Minister will talk about when the new scheme will be introduced to help 
		the people who need it most. I agree that it should be directed towards 
		low achievers, in accordance with paragraph 73. We need some specifics. 
		The Minister needs to tell us not only when the new scheme will be 
		introduced, but how much money has been spent in total, and how much of 
		that was fraud. He also needs to tell us about compensation for 
		providers. People who trusted the Government and took them at their word 
		have gone bankrupt, and have had to sell their houses. It is not enough 
		for Ministers simply to say, &quot;I'm sorry, but it's not our 
		responsibility.&quot; There is evidence on the record from departmental civil 
		servants that the attempt was made to create a market and expand the 
		number of providers. That places a moral responsibility on the 
		Department to help providers who got into trouble. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Minister should 
		also say sorry, and if he does all of the things that I asked him to do, 
		he will earn the respect of the House. <i>[Interruption.]</i> He looks 
		as if he is about to intervene. He leaned forward with great eagerness, 
		and I shall listen to his reply with equal eagerness.<br>
