<div class="asublist"><i>This speech was given during a Debate  on the East of England Ambulance Service in Westminster Hall on 25 June 2013</i>. </div>
<br>
  <p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Richard  Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</strong> It is a pleasure to speak in this debate  and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Witham (Priti Patel) on  securing it. The national health service includes many people with different  callings, and thank goodness for that. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Some have a calling to look down  microscopes and to do scientific experiments to figure out how to solve the  problem of cancer. Some have a calling to work with people with mental health  problems and to help them return to stability, productivity and a flourishing  life. Some have a calling to help at the roadside those who are in critical  danger following dreadful accidents and those of us who are unfortunate enough  to face near death. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Imagine what it must be like to have that calling, to feel  that one’s life purpose and work is to help such people, to have the training  of a practitioner in emergency medicine, but to have to hold someone who is  dying because an ambulance trust does not work properly and those higher up let  down the practitioners. What would be the reaction?</p>
  <p class="newsbody">There would come a point when people would say, “I  can’t stand this any longer. I can’t stand coming to work and failing people  because those above me are failing me.” That is exactly what has happened. It  is absolutely clear, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)  said when quoting from the Marsh report, that it is not about money. The  problem is about leadership and accountability. I will draw out some brief  points from that report. It says that</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">“critical  decision making has ceased in some areas. The trust has lost focus of the  strategic objectives, which may partly be due to the board not fully  understanding the purpose of the business.”</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">It continues:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">“The  management structure is overly layered and appears heavy…The trust seems to  demonstrate limited urgency and pace in moving forward.”</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">It also states:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">“Leadership  does not come from Board level”.</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">What are they doing, and why are they still there  after that damning report?</p>
  <p class="newsbody">As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I  have spent 12 years studying slow-motion disasters in various areas of  Government and I have read many National Audit Office reports across the whole  swathe of Government activity and public expenditure, but I have rarely read  words as damning as those. Yet the people who are responsible, who, as my hon.  Friend the Member for Harlow said, have so badly failed those whose job it is  to serve us and our constituents, are still in post. That is something I cannot  understand, and I very much hope that the Minister will address it. If it is  not addressed, there will come a point when people will start asking the Department  of Health why it has not been addressed, because the matter is so serious.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">This did not use to happen. I have been the Member  of Parliament for South Norfolk in the east of England for 12 years, and until  the last year or two I do not recall people regularly writing to me with  complaints about ambulance delays. I do not remember regularly turning up at  meetings in the House where there were 15 paramedics talking to the Minister,  Earl Howe, facilitated by east of England MPs, because there was no possibility  of their having a sensible conversation with the management of their own  organisation. This is an extraordinary state of affairs and it requires radical  reform.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">There is not time in this debate to talk about the  wider issues of the NHS culture, but reference has been made to revolving doors  and how people lose jobs in one place and gain them in another—I have seen a  lot of that myself. In addition there is the issue of confidentiality clauses  and the way in which the guidance against using them  has been weakened. In 1999, it was stated that confidentiality clauses had no  place in NHS contracts; by 2004, it was apparently okay if the guidance was  studied carefully.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">In the limited time available I want to make a  point about size. The ambulance trust in the east of England covers  Hertfordshire, which is practically outer London, and Bedfordshire, which is  also practically outer London and highly urbanised, as well as places as far  away as Cromer in north Norfolk, Great Yarmouth, Southwold in the constituency  of my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey) and Lowestoft in  the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous). It is  simply too big, and that is obvious to everyone.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">In my rural constituency, ambulances are not just  dragged away from the rural areas to Norwich. I accept the point made by the  hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert), who is no longer in his place, that it  is not just a rural problem; it is a rural and an urban problem. When I find  that ambulances are being dragged away to Bedford and Luton, which are one hour  20 minutes, one hour 25 minutes or one hour and 30 minutes from my  constituency, I know that something is fundamentally wrong. We must stop  thinking so much about economies of scale and start thinking about the economy  of flow—removing the blockages that stop things working properly.</p>
