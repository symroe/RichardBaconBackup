  </strong></strong></strong><br>
    Mr Richard Bacon (South  Norfolk) (Con):</strong> Mr Speaker - I seek leave to introduce a Bill to repeal the Human Rights  Act 1998 and for connected purposes.</p>
  <p class="style1">The Human Rights Act 1998 gives effect in UK law to the rights  and freedoms under the European Convention on Human Rights and makes available  in UK courts a remedy for breach of a Convention right.</p>
  <p class="style1">Under  Section 2 of the Act, a court or tribunal in the UK determining a question  which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must take into account  any judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court  of Human Rights.</p>
  <p class="style1">Under  Section 3, primary and subordinate legislation must - so far as it is possible  to do so - be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the  Convention rights, and this applies to any primary and subordinate legislation,  whenever it was enacted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3 also states that this provision  does not affect the validity of any incompatible legislation, although it is  also true, under Section 6 of the Act, that it is  unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a  Convention right. </p>
  <p class="style1">And as we  have seen, the view of successive governments over the years has been that when  a UK law is found to be incompatible with the European Convention, it is the UK  law which gives way to secure compliance with the Convention. </p>
  <p class="style1">And indeed  the Human Rights Act conveniently supplies a “fast track” procedure to  facilitate this happening quickly.&nbsp; Under Section 10 of the Act, a  Minister of the Crown may make such amendments to primary  legislation as are considered necessary to enable the  incompatibility to be removed, by the simple expedient of making an  Order. </p>
  <p class="style1">In effect, because the accepted  practice is that the United Kingdom observes its international obligations, a  supranational court can impose its will against ours. This is fundamentally  undemocratic.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="style1">However, there is no point in  belonging to a club if one is not prepared to obey its rules.&nbsp; The  solution is therefore not to “defy” judgments of the Court but rather to remove  the power of the Court over us.</p>
  <p class="style1">The  fundamental point is that you cannot alter the political nature of a decision  by changing the location where the decision is made.&nbsp; Judges do not have  access to a tablet of stone not available to the rest of us, which enables them  better to discern what our people need than we can possibly do - as their  elected, fallible, corrigible representatives. There is no set of values which  are so universally agreed that we can appeal to them as a useful final arbiter.  In the end, they will always be shown up as either uselessly vague or  controversially specific. </p>
  <p class="style1">In the end,  questions of major social policy - whether on abortion, or capital punishment,  or the right to bear firearms, or workers’ rights - should be decided by  elected representatives and not by unelected judges. </p>
  <p class="style1">To take the recent example of prisoner voting, the view of the  Court is that although Council of Europe member states have a  “margin of appreciation” in deciding how far prisoners should be enfranchised,  a complete ban on voting was outside that margin. The fact that we do not have  a blanket ban on prisoners voting does not seem to have troubled them, even  though the Attorney General went out his way to point this out in person when  he appeared before them.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="style1">In fact there are several  categories of prisoners who have the vote now: prisoners who are on remand;  prisoners who are sentenced but not convicted; and prisoners who are in prison  for defaulting on fines. But the Court in effect is saying “Sorry. We don’t  like your arrangements . We prefer ours.”</p>
  <p class="style1">Now although  personally I do object to the idea of prisoners having the vote, my much more  fundamental objection is to the idea that a court sitting overseas composed of  judges from, among other countries, Latvia and Liechtenstein and Azerbaijan -  however fine they may be as people - should have more say over what laws should  apply in the United Kingdom than our constituents do through their elected  Members of Parliament. </p>
  <p class="style1">Some may say  “That‘s what the UK signed up to” to which I would only reply “Precisely”.  That’s why we need to repeal the Human Rights Act and resile from the  Convention.</p>
  <p class="style1">The idea that this would make us a pariah state is simply  nonsense.&nbsp; For example, Canada is a member of the Organization of American  States - the equivalent to the Council of Europe for the Americas, but has not  signed up to the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court - without Canada’s  becoming in any sense a pariah state. </p>
  <p class="style1">Some may say  that this raises all kinds of other legal problems; that everything from the  United Nations Convention against Torture to the Good Friday Agreement is  predicated upon our membership of the European Convention, so that it would be  impossibly difficult to change things.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="style1">I do not find  this persuasive.&nbsp; It wasn’t that many years ago that people were saying  that a Bill of Rights of any kind would be impossible in the United Kingdom,  because of parliamentary sovereignty.&nbsp; The truth is that if you want to do  something badly enough you find a way to do it - and to do it legally.&nbsp;  That is precisely what one keeps clever lawyers for.&nbsp; Goodness, if you  want to badly enough, it turns out you can even go to war in defiance of both  world opinion and international law - and find a lawyer to say that what you were  doing was perfectly lawful.</p>
  <p class="style1">I would particularly commend the 2nd  Kingsland Memorial Lecture given by my Right Hon Friend the Member for Arundel  and South Downs recently, in which he sets out the argument at much greater  length.&nbsp; His central point, with which I agree, is that on prisoner voting  - as on so much else - we shouldn’t defy the ECHR. We should resile from it  altogether. </p>
  <p class="style1">I end by reflecting on the comment of Judge Learned Hand,  who said: </p>
  <p class="style1">“I often wonder whether we do not rest our hopes too much  upon constitutions, upon laws and upon courts. These are false hopes; believe  me, these are false hopes. Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it  dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no constitution, no  law, no court can even do much to help it… What is this liberty that must lie  in the hearts of men and women? It is not the ruthless, the unbridled will; it  is not the freedom to do as one likes. That is the denial of liberty and leads  straight to its overthrow. A society in which men recognize no check on their  freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage  few”.<br>
    &nbsp; <br>
  Our best check is not unelected judges but the spirit of  liberty in the hearts of the elected representatives in this House. </p>
  <p><span class="style1"><span class="style1">I commend this Bill to the House.</span></span><span class="newsbody"><br>
