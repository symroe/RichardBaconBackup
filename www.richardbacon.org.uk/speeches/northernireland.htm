			Institute of Public Finance in Northern Ireland on 23 March 2006.</cite></div>
		 <div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b><p class="speechbody">I would like to start by thanking the Institute for giving me the opportunity to speak today on Service Delivery and Accountability in Northern Ireland. 
		<p class="speechbody">Our committee is a guardian of taxpayers&#8217; money. We are not a policy committee and so by and large we do not pursue policy questions.  The nature of the PAC&#8217;s work is that we do 
<b>		<u>not</u></b> look at the &#8220;should&#8221; question &#8211; <b><u>should</u></b> the government&#8217;s policy be x or y or z, but rather at the question 
<b>		<u>if</u></b> the government pursues a particular policy, did it do so well? Did it spend taxpayers&#8217; money wisely? Did it meet the test of the &#8220;three Es&#8221; , that is, spending public money effectively, efficiently and economically?
			<p class="speechbody">In order to tackle this subject, I shall draw on my experience with NI issues at PAC, since the return of direct rule in October 2002. 
		<p class="speechbody">However, I would like to set the scene with a few observations on the context within which you operate.
			<p class="bigword6">Devolution<div class="speechbody">All of my colleagues on PAC are aware of the key role that the public service has played in holding the fabric of Northern Ireland together over the past 30 years. We recognise the professionalism with which you maintained the structures of public administration in a period of conflict.  The fact that there are still so many political uncertainties which need to be resolved in Northern Ireland makes it easy to overlook the quantum leap which the region has taken in the last 10 years.

				<p class="speechbody">I was first here 15 years ago, and it fair to say that there has been a transformation since then. The &#8216;Troubles&#8217; are very much a thing of the past. NI has moved on and no one wants to see a return to those dark days.  The challenge now is, of course, to deliver another transformation: that same public sector professionalism needs to be applied to improving public services in a post-conflict society.				</p>
				<p class="bigword6">Review of Public Administration 
<div class="speechbody">I see evidence that the challenge of reforming public services is being grasped.  The radical proposals announced last November in the Review of Public Administration are a good example. This aims to establish new relationships between local and regional government, including the reduction in the number of local councils from 26 down to 7, and similar restructuring of the Health and Education sectors.
					<p class="bigword6">Public Accounts Committee
<div class="speechbody">
					Turning to PAC, I must acknowledge at the outset that we can be very critical where we see poor performance and I am aware that Accounting Officers will sometimes accuse us being intimidating or only interested in point scoring. It is, of course, an essential part of our role to ensure that where things have gone wrong, lessons are being learned but I also believe we give credit where credit is due.
					<p class="bigword6">Examples from elsewhere in the UK
<div class="speechbody">
I think it is fair to say that Whitehall departments provide us with a regular workload of fairly spectacular problems.
					<p class="speechbody">The Ministry of Defence spent £3 billion for 67 new Apache helicopters, but half of them are sitting in storage in a shed for several years because the MOD forgot to train enough pilots in time. They also spent £259 million on 8 new Chinook helicopters which can&#8217;t fly if it is cloudy.</p>
<p class="speechbody">We saw a report on a farmer who received subsidies under the Arable Area Payments Scheme and also under the Fibre Flax scheme for what turned out to be the same piece of land. He also received subsidies for territory which, long after the payments had been made and using the grid references he had actually supplied, were discovered &#8211; entirely accidentally &#8211; to be in the North Sea between Scotland and Denmark; and on the mainland of Greenland and Iceland.</p>

		<p class="speechbody">The Home Office national probation service information systems strategy had seven project directors in seven years, five of whom knew nothing about project management. Then there was the fiasco at the Passport Office, where people couldn&#8217;t get a passport in time to go on holiday, the separate fiasco at the Criminal Records Bureau which left schools and nurseries unable to hire people because the background checks couldn&#8217;t be processed. And of course, there are the infamous problems with the Child Support Agency and with tax credits.</p>
<p class="speechbody">So I wouldn&#8217;t want you to run away with the idea that Northern Ireland is unique in getting things wrong. The government manages to mess things up quite spectacularly in the rest of the United Kingdom too!</p>
<p class="bigword6">Northern Ireland<br>
<span class="speechbody">Nonetheless, when it comes to our Northern Ireland casework, I cannot disguise the fact that the reports which we have considered have regularly turned up major issues of concern. This does frustrate the Committee, since we see NI as a region which is relatively well funded by the taxpayer which, because of its small size and potentially coherent public sector, should be an exemplar for joined up government and be capable of achieving excellence in its administration.</span></p>
	<p class="speechbody">I am well aware that we don&#8217;t take the full spectrum of the NI Audit Office&#8217;s output. Some of those reports deal with good practice such as the report into &#8216;Modernising Construction Procurement&#8217;. Such reports are not unimportant - it is right that the application and development of best practice should be encouraged and highlighted. However, the added value that PAC can give to such reports is limited, particularly given the restrictions we have on time spent on Northern Ireland issues. As a result of these restrictions we have only had the opportunity to deal with 10 NIAO Reports since your return to Direct Rule in October 2002 and I am going to comment on a selection of these.	</p>
	<p class="bigword6"><b>The Use of Operating Theatres</b><br><span class="articlebody">During 2004, the Committee decided to come over to Northern Ireland to hold two sessions on &#8216;The Use of Operating Theatres&#8217; and &#8216;Navan Centre&#8217;. This decision was taken in order to send out a clear message to the local taxpayer that someone is continuing to monitor the expenditure in the local public sector in the absence of devolution. Operating Theatres was very much the main hearing that day.

		<td valign="top" width="100%">I remember the Accounting Officer telling us that the theatres operated on a five day 7 hour shift system. However, this compares unfavourably with England and Wales where many of the theatres were available for much longer. Our concerns must be seen in the context of waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in NI. These were by far, and still are, the highest in the UK. This is despite NI having the highest per capita spend of any region in the UK.</li>		<br>

I was flabbergasted to learn that the reasons for this included the persistent taking of annual leave at the last minute by some consultants. As a result, no time was left for redeployment of scheduled anaesthetic cover and resulted in a waste of resources.

We had concluded at that time that there was no convincing explanation as to why Northern Ireland, with one of the highest levels of funding in the United Kingdom, did not get the same return on the use of its operating theatres as other parts of the United Kingdom.

		<u>persisted</u> over many years.   And yet, we saw little evidence of the Department having tackled these problems with any great vigour, prior to the Comptroller and Auditor-General&#8217;s review. This suggests to me that there was a lack of internal challenge within the Department to improve this programme.

Given the serious and ongoing concerns about the quality of training, the poor performance of a number of training providers, the limited employment impact of the programme and the substantial &#8216;skills mismatch&#8217; between Jobskills and the needs of Northern Ireland economy, we could only conclude that it provided poor value for money.

	<p class="speechbody">I note that, in the wake of our examination, Jobskills is to be axed!  My point is that it should not have taken a PAC session to achieve this.  I do not think that anywhere else in the UK, a programme as important as this but with these profound failings would have been allowed to drift on for as long as this did without drastic remedial action.	</p>

With non-compliance often leading to overpayment of premium, the only conclusion we could come to was that the Department had been failing in its duty as custodian of the public purse.

I am not going to say that NI standards are generally worse across the board than the rest of the UK. However, I must say that in some of the problem areas we have investigated (e.g. Jobskills, Sheep Annual Premiums, LEDU) we have been concerned that problems were allowed to accumulate on the scale that they did, for as long as they did. </span>					</p>
					<p class="speechbody">There may be much that is good in local administration, but when things are bad, they seem to be far below what we expect. As a member of PAC, I am worried that NI citizens and taxpayers may not be receiving the service we expect to see in the rest of the UK.

This was issued just before Christmas and provided an overview of PAC activity, its key findings and conclusions over the last 10 years. In this report, we identified seven areas which departments need to focus on if improvements in the delivery of public services are to be achieved.</span>
								<p class="speechbody">The seven areas are as follows:</p>
								<ol>
									<li class="speechbody">planning carefully prior to implementation;</li>
									<li class="speechbody">strengthening project management;</li>
									<li class="speechbody">reducing complexity and bureaucracy; (it was Einstein who said 
									&#8220;One should make things as simple as they 
									can be, but no simpler&#8221;);</li>
									<li class="speechbody">improving public service productivity;</li>
									<li class="speechbody">being more commercially astute;</li>
									<li class="speechbody">tackling fraud;</li>
									<li class="speechbody">better and more timely implementation of policies and programmes.</li>
