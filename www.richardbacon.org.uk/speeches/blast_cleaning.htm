		<p class="speechbody">
		<b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk)</b> 
		(Con): I am pleased to have secured this debate. The Minister will have 
		some familiarity with the subject because he was kind enough to host a 
		meeting with my constituent Mr. Nigel Farrow and I at the Ministry of 
		Defence on 2 July last year. He will not be surprised to hear that it is 
		in relation to Mr. Farrow that I secured the debate.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Farrow is an inventor who runs a 
		business called Farrow Systems in Loddon in my constituency. He has built 
		a successful business from scratch, which now employs 25 people. One of 
		its main products is an innovative blast cleaning method. Blast cleaning 
		involves forcing a mixture of water, air and abrasive grit - for example, 
		sand, glass beads or copper slag - through a pressure hose on to the 
		surface being cleaned. Many people will have seen old stone churches and 
		other buildings cleaned in that way. Blast cleaning has many industrial 
		and commercial applications, but there have always been problems with 
		traditional methods, the most notable being that they can cause serious 
		damage to the surface being cleaned and that a big mess is often left 
		behind. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Farrow invented a new blast cleaning 
		technology that would solve those problems. It is quicker, more accurate 
		and less messy, so operators can see what they are doing. Crucially, it 
		can be applied with much greater delicacy than any previously known 
		method, to the extent that it is possible to remove layers of varnish 
		from valuable antique furniture without damaging it or to remove layers 
		of paint from a surface one at a time. Of course, it can also be used 
		for a wide range of more industrial applications. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Farrow was invited to demonstrate 
		his new process on the BBC television programme &quot;Tomorrow's World&quot;, 
		which he duly did on 2 February 2000. After that, Mr. Farrow's telephone 
		did not stop ringing. One call was from Mr. Alan Jones of the Royal 
		Navy, who called to say that the Navy was interested in meeting Mr. 
		Farrow because - </p>

		<font SIZE="4">
		<p ALIGN="CENTER" class="speechbody">On resuming - </p>
		</font>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon</b>: I was saying that one of the many 
		telephone calls received by Mr. Farrow following the appearance of his 
		method on &quot;Tomorrow's World&quot;, the BBC television programme, was from 
		Alan Jones of the Royal Navy. Mr. Jones thought that Mr. Farrow might be 
		able to help the Navy with a long-standing problem. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Farrow was asked if Mr. Jones' 
		colleague from Defence Evaluation and Research Agency Marine Structures 
		at Rosyth naval dockyard could contact him to arrange a demonstration at 
		Rosyth, Scotland. To this Mr Farrow agreed. It is important to note that 
		Marine Structures' department at Rosyth was doing its own research on 
		removing surface coatings. That is a germane point to which I will 
		return. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Farrow duly went to Rosyth on 15 
		June 2000 for the demonstration, which was arranged by Mr. Malcolm 
		McGugan of the Ministry of Defence agency, DERA Marine Structures at 
		Rosyth. Mr. McGugan made it clear that during the maintenance and repair 
		of Royal Navy glass fibre hulled vessels, there was an ongoing problem 
		in that paint contractors, when they removed the paint, caused damage to 
		the structure of such vessels by over-blasting and that this was an 
		ongoing problem that the Navy had been unable to solve. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. McGugan said he was fed up with the 
		paint department of the Navy - the contractors, in some cases - which was 
		responsible not only for applying new paint, but for removing the 
		surface of the old; he was fed with the damage they caused to the 
		structures of glass-reinforced polymer - GRP - or fibreglass vessels through 
		over-blasting. Indeed, engineers from Marine Structures had put in place 
		a protocol that there had to be a warning bottom layer of green paint, 
		which would prevent contractors from over-blasting on the basis that 
		once they saw the green paint they would know that they had blasted 
		enough, although over-blasting continued. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. McGugan said that the paint 
		department blamed Marine Structures, saying that the marine vessels were 
		not strong enough. It subsequently became clear that the Navy had been 
		conducting intensive research for some years, but without success, on 
		how to solve the problem of over-blasting. I will ask the Minister about 
		the question of research later. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Rosyth tests on 15 June included 
		using Farrow System to remove bio-fouling such as barnacles </p>

				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;from the hull of a 2/3 scale MCMV model at Rosyth&quot;,</p>

		<p class="speechbody">also to provide a surface abrade to a 
		thick GRP panel. In attendance were a considerable number of senior MOD 
		officials and scientists, as well as contractors. Following the Rosyth 
		demonstration, on 16 June 2000 Mr. McGugan, who had arranged the trial, 
		issued a report on the results to Mine warfare IPT, which was copied to 
		others. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. McGugan's report noted the low 
		volumes of grit and water produced by the method - in other words, it 
		produced very little mess - and also that </p>
	
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;unlike current methods, the system can be used on internal 
				compartments of the ship&quot;.</p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">The report also stated that Mr. 
		Farrow's method was quick, precise and capable of removing one layer at 
		a time. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. McGugan also observed that in any 
		paint removal system the skill and experience of the operator are 
		important factors. He stated that when a powerful combination of grit 
		and pressure is used, speed is maximised, but he also highlighted the 
		fact that </p>

		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;the process relies entirely on the operative keeping the 
				pressure nozzle moving over the surface and preventing an area 
				being structurally damaged.&quot;</p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">By contrast, Mr. McGugan noted, Farrow 
		System used a relatively fine-grained soft grit and achieved a 
		considerable variation in blast strength by altering the pressure and 
		the water-grit mixture. He continued: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Thus, the 'skill' aspect of the process is moved towards the 
				calibration/set-up of the system with a subsequent reduction in 
				the possibility of damage to the GRP through inappropriate use 
				of the method by the operator.&quot; </p>
	
		<p class="speechbody">In short, Mr. McGugan acknowledged that 
		that was a helpful new development. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">There followed a rather sniffy e-mail 
		from Mr. Gary King of Sea Technology Group Materials Technology, 
		otherwise known as STGMT, who seemed to take exception to Mr. McGugan's 
		report. Mr. King wrote: </p>

				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;I have to admit surprise at the necessity for a 
				demonstration of 'Wet Blasting' as a means of paint removal. 
				This method has been the prescribed, major method of surface 
				preparation of GRP structures&quot; - </p>
		<p class="speechbody">that is, fibreglass - </p>

				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;by STGMT, for several years. </p>
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">
				Whilst I have no wish to detract from the capabilities of the 
				Farrow System, I believe it is incorrect to consider it as 
				innovative. Both FSL at Portsmouth and DML at Devonport have 
				employed similar systems for paint removal by other contract 
				companies. </p>
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">
				I am afraid I also have to disagree with the statement in the 
				report 'Unlike current methods, the Farrow System can be used on 
				internal compartments of the ship'. The greatest associated 
				problem with internal paint removal is and has always been the 
				clean-up operation.&quot;</p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">It is worth reminding the House that 
		one of the key aspects of Mr. Farrow's system is that it involves very 
		little mess compared with traditional methods. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. McGugan was furious at the e-mail 
		and replied to Mr. King that while blasting in general might not be new 
		as a technique, contract companies were over-blasting and damaging the 
		underlying GRP structure. He went on to point out that Mr. Farrow's 
		method had just been used on HMS Victory - the Minister will know that 
		that is the flagship of the Second Sea Lord, and probably the most 
		famous warship in the world - to restore delicate antique timbers, with 
		excellent results. Indeed, the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Commander 
		Frank Nowosielski, said of the restoration: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;The condition of the wood is excellent. Better still, the 
				process did not do any damage to the deck at all.&quot; </p>
			
		<p class="speechbody">In September 2000, Mr. Farrow went to Fleet 
		Support Ltd. - FSL - in Portsmouth to do a small demonstration on the 
		quayside. He was repeatedly asked whether his method was environmentally 
		friendly, which it is. That demonstration was followed by an invitation 
		to remove the surface coatings from the fresh-water tanks and bathroom 
		area of a minesweeper, as soon as he had gone through the required 
		supplier accreditation process. Mr. Farrow duly went through the 
		accreditation process, and his first opportunity to work on a ship in 
		port for its base maintenance period was with HMS Quorn. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Around that time, Mr. Roy Hussey, a 
		senior project leader at Fleet Support, warned Mr. Farrow as follows:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;Do you realise that if you mess this up we will lose the 
				fleet abroad?&quot;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In other words, the work would be done 
		elsewhere. It seems that there had been a long-standing row between 
		Marine Structures and the paint department at Fleet Support. For several 
		years, Marine Structures had been saying to the paint department, &quot;You 
		are damaging our ships.&quot; The paint department at Portsmouth was so 
		worried that it thought it might lose the fleet - it understood that there 
		was only one more chance. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">While Mr. Farrow was going through the 
		accreditation process, a trial took place in October 2000 on HMS 
		Berkeley with a Quill Falcon 50 machine from Quill International, but 
		using the conditions and parameters - the grit and pressure parameters that Mr. Farrow had shown 
		Fleet Support earlier in the year. Quill's system was given very rapid 
		approval by the ship support agency, while Mr. Farrow had to spend 
		several months fighting to be listed in the &quot;Warpaint&quot; document. Quill 
		machines started to be used, but since January 2001 Mr. Farrow has not 
		even had any inquiries, let alone the opportunity to tender for work. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In early 2001, Mr. Farrow was told that 
		someone cannot be an approved contractor unless they are in &quot;Warpaint&quot;, 
		the document for specifying standards for surface treatments, so he set 
		about getting listed. The Minister told me in his letter of 11 July 2003 
		that he had been unable to discover any reason why Mr. Farrow might have 
		been told that being listed in &quot;Warpaint&quot; was a requirement for 
		tendering for work. He assured me that that was not the case. Anyway, 
		Mr. Farrow was told otherwise. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In February 2001, while Mr. Farrow was 
		still working on HMS Victory, Mr. Roy Hussey of Fleet Support told him 
		that he wanted him to work on three minesweepers. As the HMS Victory 
		work neared completion, Mr. Farrow sought out Mr. Hussey to ask him when 
		work on the minesweepers would commence, as he had staff commitments and 
		wanted to be able to plan staff time. Because Mr. Farrow was wearing a 
		different-coloured overall from the rest of his staff, Mr. Hussey 
		mistook him for someone from a rival firm and said, &quot;I've told you 
		before: I'm happy with the Farrow System. I don't need the alternative.&quot; 
		What is more, he was fairly obviously coming under pressure to use a 
		different system from Farrow, even though he was pleased with the 
		results. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In July 2002, Farrow System was granted 
		UK patent 2344348, which relates to the heat parameter used in the 
		method. In October 2002, Farrow System was granted UK patent 2372039 in 
		respect of the pressure parameter. Farrow System has also been granted a 
		number of patents elsewhere in the world, including the United States, 
		Australia, New Zealand, Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. While we are 
		on the subject of the heat parameter in Mr. Farrow's method, it is worth 
		noting the statement by the Ministry of Defence that it was of no 
		consequence. Indeed, the Minister's letter of 19 June 2003 specifically 
		stated that there was no heating of the fluid in any application of the 
		wet-blast method to Royal Navy ships. That point was repeated to me in 
		his letter of 11 July 2003. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The MOD is now seeking to revoke Mr. 
		Farrow's patents. I shall return to that in a moment, but I want first 
		to address the important issue of water contamination. A serving officer 
		on HMS Quorn told Mr. Farrow before he started working on the Quorn, 
		&quot;You know the real reason why you're cleaning these tanks is that the 
		water is contaminated and the water from the tanks is what we drink.&quot; 
		Paint on the inside was flaking off, and the water was in direct contact 
		with the fibreglass, which had no gel coating, although perhaps it 
		should have had. The Fleet Support people had been trying to remove the 
		surface coating of the tanks but, in common with what was happening on 
		other vessels, they were over-blasting and causing serious structural 
		damage. Mr. Farrow went inside a tank and removed the coating in a 
		controlled and benign way. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I also want to mention shells, because 
		one of the calls that Mr. Farrow received following the appearance on 
		&quot;Tomorrow's World&quot; was from the bomb disposal experts at Porton Down. 
		Shells are washed up on the north Wales coast every spring during the 
		high spring tide, including chemical shells left over from the second 
		world war. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Farrow went to Porton Down on three 
		occasions between March and June 2000 and advised staff on the use of 
		the Farrow method for cleaning shells. Those staff, wearing chemical 
		protection suits, used the Farrow method to remove marine debris from 
		the shells and thereby identify which were conventional and which 
		chemical. Of course, one cannot cause a controlled explosion with a 
		chemical shell, because it would spread dangerous chemicals everywhere, 
		so although the conventional shells were disposed of once identified, 
		the chemical shells are still being stockpiled. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Robert Cox of the MOD told Mr. 
		Farrow that the experiments in cleaning the chemical and conventional 
		shells that Mr. Farrow and his staff had witnessed had been successful, 
		and that the MOD wished to purchase several units from Farrow. 
		Negotiations would be conducted by Mr. Richard Hollands of the MOD but, 
		three years later, nothing has happened, so I would like to ask the 
		Minister how the MOD is now coping with the problem of cleaning 
		conventional and chemical shells from the second world war that have 
		been washed up. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">That brings me to a series of other 
		questions, the first of which is about public procurement. Who controls 
		Fleet Support's procurement policies? Is it fair that it does not put 
		work out to tender? We are dealing with taxpayers' money, and the 
		Minister may say that it is down to the prime contractor to choose how 
		it procures services. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In a letter to Mr. Farrow's patent 
		adviser, Mr. Harrison, on 14 August 2003, Mr. Robert Beckham, director 
		of intellectual property at the Ministry of Defence, made that point 
		when he reiterated the fact that the Ministry requires the dockyard to 
		work to a standard of surface finish and that how that finish is 
		obtained is for the dockyard contractor to determine. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">None the less, it seems rather strange 
		that there are seven or eight approved painting contractors that get 
		work, most of which are not listed in &quot;Warpaint&quot;, but only two paint 
		removal methods. However, all work appears to go only to one company, 
		Quill International. I would appreciate it if the Minister supplied me 
		with all the copies of &quot;Warpaint&quot; so that we can establish when Quill 
		was first listed and when Farrow System was listed, and what the 
		previous system was for removing the surface coatings. What standards 
		were applied before Mr. Farrow showed the MOD and the Navy how to do it 
		more effectively? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Now that the MOD is seeking to revoke 
		Mr. Farrow's patents, will the Minister explain why the Ministry is 
		attacking the heat patent 2344348, given his statement in a letter to me 
		that heat is of no consequence? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Has anybody on a royal naval ship been 
		affected because of the contamination of tanks that contain fresh water? 
		If so, how many and what has been done about it? When Mr. Farrow raised 
		the issue with Mr. Gary King, who is, incidentally, the editor of 
		&quot;Warpaint&quot;, Mr. King made no attempt to deny that there was an issue with the contamination of tanks that contain fresh water. He 
		simply said to Mr. Farrow, &quot;Prove it.&quot; That is a slightly worrying 
		attitude when the health of naval personnel is at stake. If, as stated 
		by the MOD on several occasions, there has been no change to the method 
		of operation, what was the purpose of all the trials in 2000? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In December 2003, the Minister for 
		Science and Innovation, Lord Sainsbury, announced a new, radical plan 
		that the Government were considering, which would allow British 
		inventors to draw on a central fund to fight companies that steal their 
		ideas. He said that a lot of the big companies have deep pockets, which 
		means that they can fight for a long time against smaller firms or 
		individuals. I hope that that applies to big companies and not to the 
		Government, and that the Government would do all they can to encourage 
		new inventions and inventors, rather than do all they can to squash 
		them. I look forward to the Minister's reply. </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of 
		State for Defence (Mr. Ivor Caplin) </b>: I congratulate the hon. Member 
		for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) 
		on securing the debate and I am grateful to him for providing us with 
		the opportunity to discuss the matter in the Chamber this afternoon. As 
		the hon. Gentleman said, we had a very amicable meeting on the matter 
		last July, shortly after I became a Minister at the Ministry of Defence.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Over the past year, there have been 
		several articles in the press on blast cleaning of warships constructed 
		of glass-reinforced plastic, often known as GRP. The articles have also 
		alleged that the MOD has been improperly dealing with patented 
		technology in the field and they have questioned the tendering practices 
		of the Department. The hon. Gentleman has repeated many of those points 
		today, and I hope to set the record straight. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Blast cleaning is an old technology 
		that has been and is still used widely by contractors to the MOD 
		supplying support to all three of our armed services. It is used for the 
		cleaning and removal of coatings from surfaces. The fundamental 
		technical principle behind blast cleaning has been known for many years 
		and many companies operate in the United Kingdom within the field. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Blast cleaning takes place with the use 
		of a pressurised fluid on its own - for example, air or water - or with the 
		use of fluid entrained with abrasive particles such as grit entrained in 
		air or water. The pressurised fluid, or fluid-abrasive combination, is 
		impacted against the surface from which the coating is to be removed. 
		The use of blasting has been found to be useful to the armed forces for 
		the removal of paint and dirt from equipment surfaces in general. One of 
		its advantages over other forms of paint removal is that when used on 
		delicate surfaces at low pressure it does not damage the underlying 
		surface, unlike chemical solvents, which can do so in some instances. 
		Materials such as GRP are less robust than metals such as steel. Much 
		work has been done in devising or selecting blasting media, equipment 
		and processes that enable the use of blast cleaning parameters that do 
		not damage delicate surfaces. </p>
		<b>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon</b>: In Mr. McGugan's report on 16 June 2000, 
		he referred to the then ongoing research. Will the Minister supply me 
		with copies of that research? </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Caplin </b>: I will consider that 
		and reply to that point later in my response. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The solution that I was referring to 
		has been known for many years, and is typically to adjust parameters 
		such as impact pressure, grit size and grit hardness. Today's debate is 
		about blast cleaning across the armed forces, although many questions 
		are specifically directed at Royal Navy activities. However, I shall 
		address the use of blast cleaning across the whole of the armed forces.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Royal Air Force deals with 
		contractors that use materials such as plastic acrylic media, under wet 
		and dry conditions, for paint removal from aircraft and other vehicles. 
		Aluminium oxide may also be used for corrosion removal on selected 
		components. The RAF also uses low-pressure aqueous washing rigs to clean 
		aircraft. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Army deals with blast cleaners 
		under the auspices of the defence trading agency, ABRO, and uses dry 
		abrasives for paint removal prior to repair work. For the removal of 
		temporary camouflage paint, a simple water and detergent spray is used.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Royal Navy has a contract with 
		Fleet Support Ltd., which is responsible for the management of the 
		Portsmouth Dockyard, Devonport Management Ltd. and Babcock Rosyth 
		Dockyard Ltd. Those contractors may also choose to contract the task of 
		blasting to a number of sub-contractors. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">All of the issues that have arisen 
		today have been raised previously, and have emanated from questions 
		raised by Mr. Farrow, who is the managing director of Farrow System Ltd. 
		The hon. Gentleman and I met him in July. The questions have been raised 
		with specific reference to the removal of paint from GRP hulls and 
		superstructures of Royal Navy surface warships. Mr. Farrow gave a 
		demonstration of his blast cleaning equipment on &quot;Tomorrow's World&quot; in 
		2000, and an employee of the Ministry of Defence watched the programme. 
		As the Department is always interested in potentially useful techniques, 
		our member of staff felt that the claims made by Mr. Farrow were worthy 
		of further investigation. The then Defence Evaluation and Research 
		Agency Marine Structures at Rosyth, which held a watching brief for the 
		Ministry on such matters, arranged for a demonstration of the Farrow 
		system to be given at the dockyard. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Farrow gave a demonstration at 
		Rosyth for DERA Rosyth and Babcock Rosyth Dockyard Ltd. in June 2000. A 
		report was written by DERA Rosyth and sent to the Ministry's Warship 
		Support Agency and the Defence Procurement Agency, which is responsible 
		for paint techniques for surface ships. The Defence Procurement Agency 
		made it clear to DERA Rosyth that, however effective the trial was, it 
		did not represent a new technology but was known and had been prescribed 
		for GRP vessels for several years. It was particularly noted that 
		operator skill was an important factor in avoiding damage to exposed 
		areas of the surface. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Farrow has since alleged that the 
		Ministry of Defence has changed its working practice as a result of his 
		demonstration of the Farrow system at Rosyth. The Ministry simply 
		refutes that. Any problems with the removal of paint from GRP had been 
		solved a considerable time before the Farrow system became available. In 
		particular, successful trials of various abrasives for removing paint 
		from GRP surfaces were made in 1996, as a result of which, low-pressure water slurry 
		blasting, using garnet as the abrasive, was recommended. Moreover, there 
		had been earlier successful use of the known techniques at Portsmouth, 
		using olivine grit rather than garnet. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In the time left, I shall address the 
		specific legal issues raised by the hon. Gentleman and Mr. Farrow. The 
		first is that the Ministry has been using two United Kingdom patents 
		that have been granted to Mr. Farrow. The MOD's policy is to recognise 
		and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties. In 
		particular, when use is made of valid patent rights under the Crown use 
		provisions of the Patents Act 1977, the Ministry honours its legal duty 
		to compensate the patents' owners in accordance with that Act. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">On first becoming aware of the 
		allegations made by Mr. Farrow, the MOD undertook an investigation into 
		the facts. The Ministry found that most of the claimed parameters of Mr. 
		Farrow's patents were known as a result of earlier trials held in 1996, 
		and I can confirm that the Ministry found that the procedures in use at 
		Portsmouth did not fall within the claims of Mr. Farrow's patents. 
		However, it was found that the techniques used at Devonport might fall 
		within the scope of one of Mr Farrow's patents. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">However, from a study of the literature 
		that predated Mr. Farrow's patents, the Ministry considered that the UK 
		patents, despite having been granted, were invalid in the light of 
		relevant published material that had not been found by the UK Patent 
		Office. The Ministry informed Mr. Farrow that in the light of the 
		investigation, it did not consider that he had a sustainable claim for 
		compensation under the Crown use provisions of the 1977 Act. Mr. Farrow 
		does not agree with the Ministry's findings on the validity of his 
		patents, and to try to resolve the impasse, the Ministry, with Mr. 
		Farrow's knowledge, has instituted actions to seek revocation of those 
		patents before the UK Patent Office. The action was filed on 7 January 
		2004 and will take about nine months to complete. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The second legal issue raised by Mr. 
		Farrow is that the Ministry has released confidential information 
		belonging to him to other contractors and that, as a consequence, the 
		practices adopted by the Ministry's contractors have changed. From our 
		investigations, I can say that those allegations are entirely unfounded. According to 
		the DERA Rosyth report, the only contractor present at the demonstration 
		of the Farrow System at Rosyth in 2000 was the dockyard operator Babcock 
		Rosyth Dockyard Ltd. Additionally, any information that may have been 
		divulged there by Mr. Farrow was already in the public domain. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In any case, knowledge of the technique 
		demonstrated by Mr. Farrow can be traced within the Ministry to at least 
		as far back as 1996 to a report by Coating Consultants Ltd. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon</b>: Will the Minister give way? </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Caplin </b>: I am sorry, but I do 
		not have time. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Prior to Mr. Farrow's trial at Rosyth, 
		the Ministry had already solved the problem of removing paint from GRP. 
		Use of wet grit blasting at reduced pressure was already practised at 
		Devonport and Portsmouth, and there has been no change at either 
		dockyard resulting from the demonstration of the Farrow System at 
		Rosyth. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The third legal issue that Mr. Farrow 
		raised has been the probity of the tendering practices adopted for the 
		Ministry at the various dockyards. The Ministry of Defence's policy is 
		to treat contractor's information released to it in the strictest 
		confidence when it is confidential. However, since privatisation of the 
		royal dockyards, responsibility for management work at the dockyards is 
		in the hands of private contractors. The Royal Navy is a customer of the 
		respective main contractors and is not involved with directing how work 
		should be performed. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Ministry requires that the dockyard 
		works to a given standard of surface finish within a given delivery 
		period. How that finish and delivery time is met is for the dockyard 
		contractor to determine, as is the decision on whether a subcontractor 
		is brought in to do the work. The Ministry endorses certain contractors 
		and processes that it considers capable of reaching that standard, and 
		the Farrow System is one of a number that are recognised as meeting the 
		standards required. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I am out of time, and I may well have 
		to write to the hon. Gentleman on some of his other questions. </p>
