		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given during a debate on post office services on 29 January 2002
			</cite></div>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk):</b> I have enjoyed listening to the debate. </p>

		<p class="speechbody">First, there is the 
		nature of the market that we are facing. It has been said that the Post 
		Office is facing competitive threats from new technologies, industrial 
		relations and heaven knows what else. Although that is the case, it is 
		important not to forget that there is a growing market. Growth was not 
		as large last year as was predicted, but as the sub-postmaster at 
		Mulbarton in my constituency said this morning, 15 years ago there would 
		be six or seven sacks in the morning, and now there are 30 to 40. So 
		there is a growing market with an exciting future. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">The Post Office has 
		28 million footfalls through the doors of its premises every week. Most 
		retailers would kill for that. In the over 350 g market, more than 4,000 
		companies are competing. We have seen the improvement in service that 
		has resulted from that. We do not necessarily have anything to fear from 
		greater competition so long as it is handled in the right way. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Secondly, there are 
		some serious questions to ask about the management of Consignia. The 
		hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Geraint Davies), who is no longer in 
		his place, said that the income of the Post Office has risen 
		considerably, from £6 billion to £8 billion. He could have added that 
		Consignia's management has let the costs of the business run out of 
		control. Costs are up by £1.2 billion, and that is the main reason why 
		Consignia is in a hole. The problem arises not because there is no 
		market or because Consignia is not getting increased revenues, but 
		because the management is completely unable to control costs. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Reference has been 
		made to poor industrial relations. I am not surprised that they are 
		poor, given that 30,000 people were told just two weeks before Christmas 
		that they would be sacked. My experience is that companies with good 
		managements tend to have good industrial relations, and that companies 
		with poor managements tend to have poor industrial relations. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">My third point is 
		that there is only one shareholder—the Government. The NAO report 
		referred to several times in the debate states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The relationship between the Department 
				and Consignia may affect the company's commitment to improving 
				efficiency&quot; </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Later on, the report 	continues:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;It is highly unusual for a shareholder to 
				direct a company's management to pay a guaranteed minimum 
				dividend.&quot; </p>
				</dir>
			</dir></font>
			<p class="speechbody">In most businesses, 
		the management decides whether to pay a dividend, and the amount 
		involved. I accept that, during the 1980s, the Treasury sucked a lot of 
		money out of the Post Office, but the Post Office was at least making a 
		profit at the time. I should prefer the people working in the Post 
		Office to have more control over the amount of money to be paid in 
		dividend. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">The hon. Member for 
		Croydon, Central referred also to the fact that maintaining a universal 
		service would cause conflict in a profit-maximising organisation. No one 
		in his or her right mind would suggest that a universal 
		service delivering light letters at a uniform price was a 
		profit-maximising activity. It has been argued that having a universal 
		service obligation could provide a market attraction to some players, 
		but no one would suggest that such a service was, in itself, a 
		profit-maximising activity. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">I was interested in 
		the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. 
		Lazarowicz). It was interesting that he did not refer to his own private 
		Member's Bill on employee share ownership. I speak for no one but 
		myself, and I certainly would not want to commit my Front-Bench 
		colleagues on the matter, but my contention is that the best way to 
		transform the business, which has potentially exciting prospects, is to 
		hand it over to the 200,000 people who work in it. If they became the 
		majority shareholders of the business, they could help it find its 
		feet—and the markets that would ensure prosperity. <br>
