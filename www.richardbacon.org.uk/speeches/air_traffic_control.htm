			Traffic Services Ltd to the Public Accounts Committee</i><p class="asublist"><i>
			The hearing on 18 November 2002, concerned the report by the 
			Comptroller and Auditor General into the Public Private Partnership 
			for National Air Traffic Services. You can read the full report by 
			clicking <a class="listy" href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/01-02/01021096.pdf" title="The National Audit Office report into the National Air Traffic Services PPP.">
			here</a></i></p>
			</div>
		&nbsp;<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			I have a copy of the report accounts and the page concerning the 
			directors salaries, it is not particularly clear so if you can give 
			us a note setting out all of remuneration for non-executives and 
			executives for the period prior and after the part privatisation 
			that would be very helpful. It appears there were 3 executive 
			directors getting round £230,000. Tell me, given that your 
			controllers had to go on strike to get their pay rise, asking 
			government for more money, do you think the pay rise and bonuses 
			were excessive?

			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			My personal pay was settled at the time I joined the company.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> I 
			was not just talking about you, I was talking about everybody. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			So far as the second director is concerned, that contains an 
			exceptional bonus which was paid and agreed prior to PPP and which 
			triggered on the opening of Swanwick.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			This was the £69,000 to Mr Chiswick?</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			Part of the £69,000 was his general bonus and the second part, the 
			£39,000, related to Swanwick.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			Given what has happened, do you think these payments were excessive? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			The payment was contractual. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			I did not ask about its legal status. I asked whether you thought 
			this was excessive. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			It was certainly justified against the fact that he took hold of 
			this project three years before. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			If you could put it in the note. I certainly would have expected it 
			to be legal. I was asking what your personal opinion was of them. If 
			you could let us have a note on that, that would be very helpful. 
			What is your current situation so far as shortage of controllers is 
			concerned? How many are you short now? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			In Swanwick we are now in the winter season so we would not normally 
			open as many sectors as we would in the summer. Our plans are 
			focused on next summer and a considerable amount of work is going 
			into the planning for next summer. On our current estimates we would 
			think that we could be up to 12 controllers short for next summer, 
			but we are working on that and our plan is not settled.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			My question is about now, what are you at now? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			From the summer we were 40 short. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			Could you say that again?</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			Between 30 and 40 short this summer.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			And right now?</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			I do not have the precise number as of this moment. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon: </b>
			Could you send us a note showing how it has changed in the past and 
			what you are anticipating in the future? 
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			Sure. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon: </b>
			How many days have you bought back? 	
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			You mean in terms of the deal that we did we controllers for 
			voluntary attendance? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon: </b>
			Yes, how many days?
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt: </b>
			I could give you a note on that. Very few so far, they would mainly 
			be for summer next year. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			How many days off are controllers owed? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt: </b>
			As part of the pay deal we are buying out their days off. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			I was not asking you that, with respect. 
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt: </b>
			I have not got the number at my fingertips. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			I would like to know how many days off controllers are owed. If you 
			cannot answer the question now could you not answer a different 
			question I did not ask but just save us time and send us a note. I 
			do not have a lot of time and it is just annoying when I get an 
			answer that is not an answer to the question I asked. Could you say 
			what has been the increase in overload reports? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			I can give you a precise number on that but, again, I would want to 
			give you a note. There has certainly been an increase but that has 
			apparently been a consequence of Swanwick coming into operation.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			Are you familiar with the form that controllers fill in when they 
			have a report? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			Yes, a 1261. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			Is it correct that the form has been changed so that it no longer 
			has to be countersigned by the watch manager and supervisor? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			That I do not know, I would have to check. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			Again if you could let us have a note. I understand it did used to 
			have a section underneath where the watch manager or supervisor had 
			to agree or not agree with the comment logged by the controller. I 
			am told this section has now been removed and I would like to know 
			if that is the case or not. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			I would have to check. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			Your approval under Article 88 of the Navigation Orders; is it 
			permanent or temporary? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			I think it is an indefinite approval.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			You think it is? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			Yes.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			What about when it was first given in January, was it permanent or 
			temporary? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			Indeed it was --- I will need to check that but my understanding --- 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			There is a letter to you from Mr Dancer, the head of Air Traffic 
			Safety Standards Department from 22 January in which he tells you 
			that your Article 88 Air Navigation Order approval has again been 
			time-limited. It cannot be indefinite and time-limited at the same 
			time, can it? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			I would need to check that. 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"<b><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			Which is it now? Indefinite? 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			My understanding is that it is indefinite but I would need to check.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Chairman (Mr 
			Edward Leigh MP):</b> You seem to have to check a lot of things. You 
			run this thing. 
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> 
			I did not come prepared for operational questions, I thought we were 
			talking about the NAO Report.
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> I 
			am curious because the Health and Safety Executive on 18 January, 
			four days before you opened, said there were concerns about safety 
			in relation to the centre and what it called &quot;design deficiencies&quot; 
			which may have implications in relation to air safety and that as a 
			result of that, presumably, that was why you were given a 
			time-limited approval? 
						<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr 
						Everitt:</b> No.
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> 
			That is not the case? 
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt: </b>
			I do not think that is the case at all. We were given checks before 
			we opened Swanwick and the safety regulator was perfectly content 
			that Swanwick met all aviation safety requirements and the health 
			and safety issues were around the possible effects on people at 
			work, as it were; they were not air safety issues.
			<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon: </b>
			Is it a matter of the regulator's opinion or is it a question of 
			what the law says? 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> The 
aviation safety regulator clearly has to make judgments, as most regulators 
would have to in these circumstances, and those were the CAA's judgments.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon: </b> What I want 
to know is if your contempt was okay, why did your approval say, and I have got 
a copy of it here: &quot;This approval is effective from 26 January 2002 to 26 July 
2002, unless revoked, varied or suspended&quot;, and why was it given this 
time-limited condition? 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> Can I just 
check for one moment. Could I give you a note on that rather than speculate.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> You have been 
telling me in your first answers that the approval was indefinite. 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> That is my 
understanding.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> This is a 
fairly fundamental thing, whether you can operate or not. It says here: &quot;Air 
Navigation Order Article 88, approval for the provision of air traffic 
services.&quot; That is what you do, is it not? 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> Indeed.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> So this is 
the right piece of paper I have got. You have approval here subject to the 
conditions stated in the schedule and it has got a date on it and it says 
effective to 26 July. In your first answer to me on this subject you were saying 
it is indefinite. It plainly is not indefinite, is it? 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> My 
understanding relates to the current approval we have. We have approval to 
operate an air traffic service as issued by the regulator.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> I hope you 
do. My question was whether it is a permanent approval. 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> Could I 
give you a note on that.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> Yes please, 
fine. I want to ask you about height capping. I understand this is a standard 
procedure in the industry. How much has height capping increased since Swanwick 
opened? 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> I can give 
you a percentage but obviously, as we have boarded in and dealt with the 
situation this summer, there has been an increase in height capping, yes, and 
that has been part of the management of the system as we have worked through the 
opening of Swanwick.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> Could you 
give me a note - and perhaps you can answer it now and if you can that would be 
great - on how many journeys there have been which have been height capped since 
Swanwick opened? 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> I think 
that would be difficult but I will do my best.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> And also over 
the last three years at West Drayton prior to Swanwick opening how many journeys 
were height capped? 
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Everitt:</b> I will do 
the best I can but we obviously do not measure each one.
<p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mr Bacon:</b> No further 
questions. </p>
