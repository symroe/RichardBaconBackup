		<p class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in the House of 
			Commons on 23 October 2008 as part of the Public Accounts Committee 
			debate</cite></p>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> It 
		is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), 
		who is a forensic member of the Public Accounts Committee; his 
		contributions are always appreciated by its members, of whichever party.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I endorse the Chairman of the Committee&#8217;s comments 
		about public expenditure, and the recent bank recapitalisation, in 
		particular. It is entirely appropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor 
		General to examine the huge sum involved on behalf of taxpayers, and I 
		very much hope that the Treasury agrees with that and will assist the 
		National Audit Office in every way.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Secondly, I wish to comment on the issue of 
		financial management, which has been to the fore in many of the 
		Committee&#8217;s reports. When I first starting asking what proportion of 
		principal finance officers&#8212;finance directors, as they are now called&#8212;in 
		Departments have an accountancy qualification, the answer was 23 per 
		cent. The Treasury recently told us that the answer is now 91 per cent, 
		and although that figure excludes the big exception of the Ministry of 
		Defence&#8217;s finance director, who is in charge of £32 billion of 
		expenditure, enormous progress has been made. I congratulate the 
		Treasury and other Departments on starting to realise that the topic is 
		important and that they have to do something about it. The progress 
		should not go unremarked; the Treasury has understood the importance of 
		the matter.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		That makes it all the more important for the Treasury to give a sensible 
		account of tax credits, the subject of the Committee&#8217;s eighth report. It 
		stated that</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:36.0pt">&#8220;there is little 
		evidence the Department has the scheme&#8221;&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		the tax credits scheme&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:36.0pt">&#8220;under control. Many 
		claimants continue to struggle to understand tax credits and why they 
		are overpaid. There have been many complaints about the process for 
		recovering overpayments and the Ombudsman continues to receive and to 
		uphold a large number of complaints...This level of error led the C&amp;AG 
		to qualify his opinion on the HMRC Trust Statement for the fifth year 
		running. The Department still has no targets for reducing error and 
		fraud.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		If we think that financial management is important, and if the Treasury 
		thinks it is important enough to ensure that qualified finance directors 
		are in place across Whitehall, surely it is important enough to ensure 
		that the department that comes directly under the Treasury&#8217;s own 
		control&#8212;Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, which has the task of 
		collecting the money that we then spend on various public expenditure 
		programmes&#8212;is itself under sufficiently tight financial management that 
		it can account for how it spends its money. At the moment, it is unable 
		to do so&#8212;it has not been able to do so for several years. I hope that we 
		will be told when the Treasury expects the Comptroller and Auditor 
		General to be able to sign off HMRC&#8217;s accounts as clean, because it is 
		only right that what is good for other Departments should be good for 
		the Treasury and its subsidiary departments.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		I wish to make another quick point about tax credits. A settlement was 
		reached between EDS and HMRC concerning the tax credits fiasco. The 
		Treasury originally <br>
		claimed that EDS should pay it £209 million, but that was later cut to 
		an agreed settlement figure of £71 million. Only about £44 million of 
		that was paid in cash or near cash, the remainder, £26.5 million, was to 
		come from future revenues on contracts that EDS had not yet won with 
		government. In other words, it is to come from future business. Apart 
		from the fact that that gave Government Departments a rather strong 
		incentive to award EDS further business despite, rather than because of, 
		its track record, it has been clear that over the past two and half to 
		three years since the agreement was reached hardly any money has been 
		paid. Most of the £26.5 million is still unpaid; a few hundreds of 
		thousands have been paid and there was one payment of £20,000. The 
		chairman of HMRC for the time being knows that every time he comes 
		before the Committee&#8212;unfortunately, I was abroad when he came before us 
		last time, in early October&#8212;I shall ask him how much money he has had. 
		He always comes prepared with the answer. Indeed, his distinguished 
		predecessor Paul Gray, who honourably resigned over the issue of the 
		missing discs, said that he would have been most disappointed had the 
		question not been asked. I will continue to ask the question.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Dr. Pugh:</b> 
		I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman missed the last occasion, but the 
		question was asked in one form or another and litigation was threatened 
		by the chief executive of HMRC. I do not think that we believed him, but 
		the hon. Gentleman might be interested in that observation.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who 
		brings me to the point that I was about to make, which is that the 
		various representatives of HMRC have made it very clear that they have 
		been documenting millions of pages of material relating to the case so 
		that they can, if necessary, litigate. But they really ought not to have 
		to. It is in the nature of large scale computer contracts that they 
		hardly ever go to litigation because, at the end of the day, the only 
		people who win are the lawyers. It is much better to avoid litigation. 
		However, EDS should recognise its responsibilities in this area.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">If one goes to the Vote Office and asks for the PAC bundle, one is given 
		all this material I have beside me. My hon. Friend the Member for 
		Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) said that she was rather 
		intimidated by it; after all, it was Fidel Castro who said that any 
		speech of less than four hours cannot be doing any good. I was tempted 
		to be a little more expansive, but the Chairman reminded me that it is 
		impolite to speak for longer than the Chairman himself. He only spoke 
		for 20 minutes, so I will have to restrain myself.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		I wanted to comment briefly on QinetiQ, which seems to have displayed 
		some unwelcome tendencies among civil servants. Lord Gilbert, the former 
		Labour Defence Minister, said on the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme about Sir John 
		Chisholm, the boss of QinetiQ:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:36.0pt">&#8220;Never once in my 
		presence did Sir John Chisholm indicate that he might have a conflict of 
		interest or he was going privately to be enriched by what was going on.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		In the Defence Committee, the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) 
		also quizzed Sir John Chisholm at great length about whether or not 
		there was a financial gain for him and whether he was likely to get 
		shares. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The transcript can be seen on page 19 of the 
		evidence. It was absolutely clear that he evaded telling anyone that he 
		was going to benefit financially or through shares. The Chairman of the 
		Defence Committee said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote">&#8220;You know what I am 
		getting at. I do not want to see people leaving the Ministry of Defence 
		who have been part of the negotiation... and within 6 months 12 months 
		or so ending up on a tripled salary.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		We know that, for an investment of £130,000, Sir John Chisholm ended up 
		with £25 million of equity in the business. It is probably a bit less 
		than that now, but the principle still applies. No safeguards were put 
		in place. The permanent under-secretary, Bill Jeffrey, made it clear to 
		us that there were no safeguards. The Treasury must revisit the whole 
		issue of QinetiQ and make sure that in any future transactions of that 
		kind, better safeguards are put in place. Many of our constituents are 
		very angry about it and many parliamentary colleagues were very angry 
		about the fact that such a transaction was allowed to occur.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		I wanted briefly to mention the progress on the Rural Payments Agency, 
		which the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) mentioned. Johnston 
		McNeill, the chief executive of the agency, came before us and I was 
		quite impressed by his evidence. He gave quite a good account of 
		himself. I have read in detail the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
		Committee report on the whole fiasco and he did have a lot of 
		responsibility. But it is also clear that that should have been shared 
		more widely.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		I find it extraordinary that an agency with the title of the Rural 
		Payments Agency had the job of making payments but was unable to tell 
		farmers either the date when they would get their payments or how much 
		they had already been paid. I once worked out the number of payments per 
		employee of the agency, and I think that it was 29. The employees could 
		have been sent out to the farms, with a day for travel there, a day on 
		the farm and a day for travel back, and the whole thing could still have 
		been done and dusted in three months if the payments had been made by 
		personal visit and manually. If people phone their banks, they can find 
		out if they have received a payment and for how much, but that so-called 
		payments agency was unable to provide those figures, which speaks 
		eloquently of the scale of its failure.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		I hope that the Treasury studies the reports from the PAC and the 
		Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee and tries to learn the 
		lessons. I agree with the right hon. Member for Islwyn that not enough 
		effort is always made to learn the lessons, and that must change.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		There is a hopeful straw in the wind, because the Treasury has appointed 
		Mr. Martin Read, the former boss of Logica, to try to teach it how to 
		run IT projects and to jettison them as quickly as possible when it 
		becomes apparent that they have gone wrong, again. There was a 
		tremendous headline in a story in an online magazine about the 
		appointment, although it may not be entirely parliamentary:</p>
		<p class="speechquote">&#8220;Ex-Logica boss to 
		teach UK.gov how to identify crap IT&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		The project apparently involves Mr. Read looking at how to keep</p>
		<p class="speechquote">&#8220;dedicated teams on 
		projects from start to finish&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">and at</p>
		<p class="speechquote">&#8220;not being afraid to 
		abandon a project just because it&#8217;s high profile&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		However, the article points out:</p>
		<p class="speechquote">&#8220;Both those aims would 
		run totally counter to the traditional...way of doing things. The very 
		essence of politics and public sector work is to never finish a project 
		and to get out while the going&#8217;s good. And because no one has a start to 
		finish view of a particular project, no-one can really see how crippled 
		it is, so the chances of anyone sticking their neck on the line and 
		saying it should be pulled are next to zero.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		I hope that that is too cynical a view and that Mr. Read&#8217;s work will 
		yield some benefits. The fact that he was forced out of Logica after a 
		profit warning following a European buying spree in 2007&#8212;so that he 
		presumably bought the companies involved at the top of the market&#8212;causes 
		me some concern, but I wish him well.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">
		My final remarks concern the national programme for IT in the health 
		service. We do not have a report on that before us, although it is a 
		long-term project that has been running for some six years, and is 
		therefore now six years late. Two years ago it had been running for four 
		years and was four years late, so little change there. There has been a 
		development since we last had a chance to discuss it&#8212;the withdrawal of 
		one of the major contractors, Fujitsu. Baroness Thornton described its 
		departure in the other place as &#8220;a sign of strength&#8221;, which is an 
		interesting way to put it. Essentially, Fujitsu was prepared to fulfil 
		the terms of its contract, but the Government have said that they would 
		rather keep the project money than have that happen, thus risking a £700 
		million lawsuit, which&#8212;according to the press&#8212;Fujitsu is now 
		threatening. And that is a sign of strength, apparently. It reminds me 
		of Tom Lehrer&#8217;s comment when Henry Kissinger received the Nobel peace 
		prize that it was the end of satire. If that is a sign of strength, what 
		would be a sign of weakness?</p>
