		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>Mr. 
			Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> I am pleased to have the 
			opportunity to contribute to the debate, to congratulate my hon. 
			Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) on securing it and 
			to endorse the last comments of my hon. Friend the Member for West 
			Suffolk (Mr. Spring). He said that it is a mistake to think that big 
			is necessarily better. That speaks directly to the points made by my 
			constituency neighbour, the right hon. Member for Norwich, South 
			(Mr. Clarke), when he adduced arguments of both cost and coherence. 
			At least he had the grace to admit that there would be an up-front 
			cost and that there was a discussion to be had about the payback 
			period. That point was made by several of us in the previous debate 
			on this issue.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">Indeed, I 
			endorse the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk 
			about this feeling like a trip down memory lane. It reminds me of 
			Yogi Berra, the baseball star of the New York Yankees, who said, 
			&#8220;This is like déjà vu all over again&#8221;, not just because the subject 
			of the debate is local government, but because of the Minister who 
			is responding to it. The first time that I came across him was in 
			this Chamber, when he was again trying to defend the 
			indefensible&#8212;the actions of another Secretary of State, the right 
			hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), in relation to 
			an adult training scheme. It seems to be his lot in life to have to 
			go round picking up the pieces after various Ministers above him 
			have made a complete mess of things. That was one of those cases of 
			&#8220;Never mind the quality, feel the width.&#8221; Someone&#8212;perhaps it was 
			even me&#8212;quoted Stalin, saying that quantity has its own quality. The 
			headline in that case was that the 1 millionth individual learning 
			account holder had been secured, never mind that there was fraud all 
			over the place.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">In this 
			case, I have my doubts about the argument of the right hon. Member 
			for Norwich, South about size. After all, when he was trying to push 
			through the police constabulary changes, it became apparent that one 
			of the best constabularies was also one of the 
			smallest&#8212;Gloucestershire. It had some of the best indicators in 
			terms of value for money, but also in the degree of compliance with 
			its key performance indicators and acceptance by the public.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>	Mr. 
		Charles Clarke: </b>Will the hon. Gentleman accept that in my 
			intervention earlier I did not mention size? I think that there are 
			arguments about size to be had, but I did not make the case about 
			size. I made the case, as he said, about coherence and cost. I do 
			not in general believe that bigger is best; I do in general believe 
			that to have one authority providing all the services in a locality 
			is better than to have two or three different authorities doing 
			that.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>Mr. 
			Bacon:</b> I accept that the right hon. Gentleman did not mention size, 
			although he did refer to Greater Norwich, and Greater Norwich would 
			of course be bigger than the present Norwich and would involve quite 
			a lot of parishes in the north of my constituency going into Greater 
			Norwich. They do not want to be part of Greater Norwich. They do not 
			want to be part of Norwich city council, not least because their 
			council tax would probably go up by about 50 per cent. from the 
			already considerable level that it has reached in recent years after 
			many years of Liberal Democrat control of the district council, but 
			also because it is not clear to anyone that Norwich city council 
			knows how to run a bath. Until that becomes clear, no one&#8212;no one 
			with any sense, at any rate&#8212;seems to think that it should be given 
			responsibilities additional to those that it already has.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">I do not 
			want to take up much more time, but I want to make two final points. 
			One concerns the relationship between the Department for Communities 
			and Local Government and the boundary committee. My hon. Friend the 
			Member for Mid-Norfolk mentioned that the committee did not seem to 
			realise that it could have come up with other options than the one 
			that it did, which speaks to an extraordinary lack of communication 
			between the Department and the boundary committee.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">That was 
			made even more manifest in a letter that the Minister wrote on 9 
			February 2009, which is worth quoting at length. In it, he says that</p>
			<p class="speechquote" align="left" style="text-align:left">&#8220;the 
			Secretary of State made the request for advice, accompanied with 
			Guidance to the Boundary Committee on 6 February 2008&#8221;&#8212;</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">just over 
			a year ago. He goes on to say:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" align="left" style="text-align:left">&#8220;We 
			included the term &#8216;in aggregate&#8217; in the request to make clear that 
			any alternative proposals for unitary local government must have the 
			capacity to meet the five criteria across the specified area. The 
			February 2008 request for advice was quite clear in its terms. If 
			the Secretary of State had intended that each part of the proposal 
			had to meet the criteria independently, then she would not have 
			needed to specify that the proposal in aggregate had to meet the 
			criteria as well. If each part of the proposal met the five criteria 
			it would follow that the proposals for the county area as a whole 
			would too. I set this out clearly to the Chair of the Boundary 
			Committee in correspondence I copied to him in March 2008.&#8221;</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">This is 
			the extraordinary part. The letter continues:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" align="left" style="text-align:left">&#8220;We then 
			had no indication that the Boundary Committee might be taking a 
			different approach until we saw the financial information published 
			by the Boundary Committee on 21 November 2008. Having considered 
			that information&#8221;&#8212;</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">this goes 
			back to my point about the unfortunate Minister having to clear up 
			after various Secretaries of State&#8212;</p>
			<p class="speechquote" align="left" style="text-align:left">&#8220;it was 
			not clear to the Secretary of State that the Committee was 
			approaching the assessment of alternative proposals on the basis she 
			had envisaged.&#8221;</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">We are 
			supposed to believe that from February or at least March 2008 right 
			up until 21 November, the boundary committee thought that it was 
			doing one thing and the Secretary of State thought that it was doing 
			another, so for eight or nine months she had not realised that it 
			was not doing what she thought it was doing. It is no good the 
			Minister saying&#8212;if he does respond by making this point&#8212;that the 
			boundary committee is independent. Of course it is independent. The 
			Electoral Commission is independent. That does not mean that it does 
			not have constant discussion with political parties. The National 
			Audit Office is independent. That does not mean that it does not 
			have constant discussion with the various Departments and Executive 
			agencies that it is auditing; it is in dialogue with them all the 
			time. It is extraordinary that that miscommunication could have been 
			allowed to sit there for nine months. Such confusion between the 
			Secretary of State and the boundary committee is inexcusable. I hope 
			that the Minister does not try to defend it; it is indefensible. The 
			best thing that he could do is simply apologise.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">My final 
			point is about the financial condition of this country. We have just 
			heard that the Treasury tax revenues for the month of January are £7 
			billion below where they were expected to be, compared with last 
			year. Of course, that will have an impact on local government. It 
			can hardly not, when 75 per cent. of the revenues for local 
			government come from the centre. Local government itself has 
			considerable financial problems. I sat down with the chief officers 
			of South Norfolk district council only a few weeks ago, and it was 
			evident that on any number of fronts, the income stream of the 
			district council was being adversely affected. I am sure that the 
			same applies throughout the country. Planning fees are down. 
			Goodness knows council tax income will probably be lower as more 
			people are unemployed and claiming council tax benefit. There are 
			any number of ways in which local government, through its own 
			income, will be suffering financially.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">Even if 
			the right hon. Member for Norwich, South is right about the 
			proposal&#8212;I doubt that he is&#8212;he at least acknowledged that there was 
			a discussion to be had about the payback. We so often hear about 
			proposals for restructuring and for churning local government and, 
			indeed, central Government structures as though it is the structure 
			and the change itself that produces the benefit. Sir Michael Barber, 
			in his book on the Prime Minister&#8217;s delivery unit, &#8220;Instruction to 
			Deliver&#8221;, says that what matters most is not the structure, but 
			routines and good working relationships, and that is exactly what we 
			have with joint working. My hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk 
			was right to say that that could be extended. It is being extended, 
			and it is working quite well. It could work better. Relationships 
			between planning and transportation at county level and district 
			council planning departments are getting better. They know each 
			other; they know their responsibilities; they know how they 
			interact. That can certainly be developed without a huge up-front 
			cost, for which the payback will potentially be over many years.</p>
			<p class="speechbody" align="left" style="text-align:left">The best 
			thing that the Minister could do, after this Horlicks that has been 
			going on for several years now, is gracefully withdraw and 
			acknowledge that now is not the right time to be pushing forward 
			these proposals.</p>
