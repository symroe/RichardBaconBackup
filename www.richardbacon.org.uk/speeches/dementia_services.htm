			the House of Commons on
			27 October 2004</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> I 
		congratulate the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) on securing 
		this debate, and I pass on to him the thanks of Mr. Iain Dale for having 
		done so; I know that Mr. Dale secured a meeting at Rebecca house on a 
		cross-party basis to express the widespread concerns of residents and 
		relatives about the position being taken by the trust. 

</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I want to highlight for the Minister a fact to 
		which the hon. Gentleman alluded - this is not an isolated case, and the 
		same situation is widespread across Norfolk. Indeed, there are five such 
		units, including Cygnet house in Long Stratton in my constituency, which 
		I understand the Minister visited today. I also understand that some 
		friendly local fox hunters were present to greet him, although I had 
		nothing to do with that. I hope that he found the visit congenial, 
		notwithstanding some of the people by whom he was greeted. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Cygnet house is one of the five units for the 
		elderly across Norfolk. It has units catering for long-term residential 
		care for the elderly mentally ill, and it also offers respite care. The 
		number of units can vary from day to day. On 25 October, it had 11 
		residents, compared with 14 in Rebecca house. Adding Ellacombe, Yew Tree 
		and Laburnam, which are located in Norwich, produces a total of 49 
		places on that date - a number that will fall to some 28, as the hon. 
		Gentleman said, under the proposals. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">That raises a number of concerns. First, some 
		facilities, especially at Cygnet house, are very local to people in 
		South Norfolk, for whom it is not always easy to get into Norwich, 
		especially when they are elderly people. The Minister will have seen 
		today how large my constituency is; it covers some 350 sq miles. At the 
		moment, Cygnet house provides easy access for relatives, and there is no 
		doubt that Norwich is more difficult to visit. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In addition to the question of access, there is 
		the quality of care that is provided. The father of a councillor in my 
		constituency, Councillor Martin Wilby, has been at Cygnet house for two 
		and a half years, and has received excellent care, both physically and 
		mentally. Mr. Wilby senior has been in homes of various kinds for some 
		10 years, but his time at Cygnet house has been the best, according to 
		Councillor Wilby. Mr. Wilby senior spent some time at Hellesdon hospital 
		in Norwich, but there was a high staff turnover and the care could be 
		patchy. Cygnet house, which has a low staff turnover and a higher and 
		more consistent quality of care, is in my view and that of many local 
		people better for residents. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The hon. Member for North Norfolk also alluded to 
		cost, which is the other issue that I want to raise. I have a copy of 
		the report to the board of the Norfolk and Waveney Mental Health 
		Partnership NHS trust, which refers to potential options for Cygnet 
		house, including the refurbishment of the facility and its use as a care 
		unit for the whole of central Norfolk. However, the report states that 
		if that option were pursued, clinical and out-of-hours cover, as well as 
		the high revenue costs, would raise concerns. On the face of it, it 
		seems that the change is a cost-cutting exercise, with not enough 
		thought being given to the needs of elderly people with mental health 
		problems who need specialist care, and it does not seem right to make 
		relatives pick up the tab, again. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I strongly endorse the point made by the hon. 
		Member for North Norfolk that Norfolk's demographic profile is old and 
		that in many cases it is getting older - people move to many parts of my 
		constituency in order to retire - so dementia services will grow, not 
		decline, in importance. There are serious concerns about whether the 
		trust's proposal is the right way forward. I have asked Pat Holman, the 
		chief executive of the partnership, to reconsider the closure of Cygnet 
		house, and I look forward to the Minister's reply. </p>
