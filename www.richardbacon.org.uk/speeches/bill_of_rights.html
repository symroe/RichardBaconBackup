  <h3>Defending the right to communicate with your Member of Parliament</h3>
  <hr size="1" id="line"><br>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Richard Bacon</span><em> (South Norfolk) (Con):</em> It is a pleasure to take part in this debate, Mr Bone. I  was very keen to do so after discussions with my hon. Friend the Member for  Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming), because of some of the things that he had  described about the bullying of constituents. The idea of a debate immediately  commended itself to me because of instances in my own constituency. You will be  pleased to hear, Mr Bone, that I shall not dwell in great detail on any of  them, and also that the particular instance I had in mind was nothing like as  severe as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I had a case where two parents came to see me about  their child, who was being bullied in school. The child had an autistic  spectrum condition and was also visually impaired. Those were contributing  factors to his being bullied at school and the parents wanted me to help to  sort it out. On a subsequent occasion, at a meeting with the school, the  parents were told that it would probably be better if they did not go back and  see me again. Naturally enough, I took umbrage at that, on the same basis as  the stories told by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley. In  substance, however, it did not make much difference, because in essence I  ignored the school's request, which it had not made to me. I continued to help  the parents, continued to advocate on their behalf and, indeed, met with the  school. The issue was-how can I put it?-improved, if not fully solved  satisfactorily.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The principle of constituents being told that they  should not contact Members of Parliament is deeply offensive to me, as I think  it would be to most Members. The principle that a court of law should order  someone not to contact their Member of Parliament, which I was not aware of  until I had detailed discussions with my hon. Friend, is even more offensive. I  contend that, according to the Bill of Rights, it is not correct or possible  for a judge to make such an order, because the ability of a constituent to  contact an MP so that they can help to deal with a grievance, whatever it is,  is of the essence-it is fundamental.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">John Hemming:</span>  Would my hon. Friend agree that making such an order is, in effect, an attempt  to interfere with the workings of Parliament by preventing Parliament from  obtaining information?</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon:</span> Yes, I  absolutely would. I am no constitutional lawyer, but my belief is that an  English judge trying to make such an order is in contempt of Parliament, which  is, after all, a court. I know that people tend to roll their eyes when the  subject of the High Court of Parliament is raised, but the fact is that it is a  court, and that, ultimately, it has sovereign power in this country.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The subject of parliamentary privilege has been raised  on several occasions, and I, too, shall refer to it. The phrase  &quot;parliamentary privilege&quot; is particularly unfortunate, especially in  the modern world. The word &quot;privilege&quot; has almost entirely pejorative  connotations. I prefer to call it the right of MPs to speak up for and defend  the British people, which I think is a much better way of conveying what we  mean by parliamentary privilege. In my parliamentary career, I have certainly  taken advantage of my right as an MP to use parliamentary privilege to speak up  for and defend the British people in my work.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">A particular case came to my attention because of  paperwork that was sent to me by an official in Her Majesty's Revenue and  Customs. The dossier showed that people from eastern Europe-criminal gangs, in  fact-were coming to this country, getting employment in low-paid jobs and then  applying for tax credits. Once the tax credit claim had been made and a British  bank ccount had been set up for the payments, the  fraudsters returned to their home country. They left their employment but  continued to receive tax credit payments which were extracted using a cash card  in various points east-in different cities in eastern Europe. In some cases,  the fraudsters managed to make several thousand pounds, which they used to buy  homes in parts of eastern Europe where property is much cheaper: Slovakia, parts  of Romania and elsewhere.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">When I was sent the information, I thought that it was in  the public interest that something should be done, and that that was part of my  job as an MP. I have sat on the Public Accounts Committee since I was elected  in June 2001. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and  Howden (Mr Davis) was the Chairman of the Committee on the day that I first  attended a meeting of it. I have had great concern throughout my parliamentary  career for the proper use of public money, and for ensuring that it is not  squandered.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I thought that the right thing to do was to make sure  that the information came into the public domain, but I was careful to ensure  that nothing might be disclosed that would impede any investigation of what was  happening, or disclose to anyone how it was that I had come by the information,  other than to say that it was sent to me by an official. I certainly did not  want to disclose who the official might be. I had his name and mobile phone  number on my Blackberry and other information that would have disclosed his  identity, but I felt safe in the knowledge that were I simply to send the  dossier to the Comptroller and Auditor General at the National Audit Office and  ask him to investigate it, things would happen, something would be done and the  fraud would be stopped. Indeed, that is what happened.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Imagine my surprise to find that, in doing his job, another  MP-a colleague of mine to whom my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice  and Howden referred a moment ago-who is now the Minister for Immigration was  arrested by the police. That caused me not a little concern. I remember at the  time that my hon. Friend's office was ransacked by the police in what I  regarded as an unlawful and unwarranted search-in fact, unlawful search and  seizure of his possessions and documents-and that his Blackberry was taken away  from him. One can imagine what I started to think: what if that happened to me?  What if my Blackberry were taken away from me, with the telephone number on it  of the HMRC official who had given me important information which I thought it  was my job to disclose, in the public interest?</p>
  <p class="newsbody">For that reason, I was deeply perturbed by the arrest of my  hon. Friend. It breached some important principles. One of the most important  is that there has to be a certain amount of agreement. Our political system can  operate only if there is agreement between different political actors and  parties on certain fundamentals, and one of them is that the Government of the  day shall not use the resources of the state to harry and intimidate their  opponents. Indeed, I was pleased when Her Majesty's inspectorate of  constabulary produced its report, &quot;Review of the Lessons Learned from the  Metropolitan Police Service's Investigation of Home Office Leaks&quot;, in  which it stated:</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&quot;Departments  and the Cabinet Office should have the capability to deal with the  matter&quot;-</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">the leaks from the Home Office-</p>
  <blockquote class="newsbody">&quot;and should not have to rely on the police. The smooth  running of Government is an understandable concern but not an obvious matter  for the police.&quot;</blockquote>
  <p class="newsbody">When the former chief constable of the British Transport  Police, Sir Ian Johnston, undertook his inquiry at the request of the  Government, he also found that the actions of the Home Office and of the police  had not been proportionate. He said that the leaks amounted to embarrassment  for the Government but did not threaten national security.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The whole case was peculiar to anyone who had followed the  legislation in the late 1980s which put the security service on a statutory  basis and separately redefined the law of official secrets. A significant  purpose of the legislation was to remove from the ambit of the criminal law  whole swathes of Government information, so that the wrongful disclosure of  information by an official to someone else would not itself be a criminal act  but would be a civil matter that would be dealt with under the law of  employment contract. That was a welcome development. One would not have  expected that disclosures of the kind that were made could possibly have led to  an arrest for potential criminal action because there was no criminal action,  as was subsequently shown.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I certainly would not have expected to have the police  knocking on my door, looking for papers, because of what I had been doing in  respect of the tax credits fraud committed by people from eastern Europe.  Following the scandal of the arrest of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford  (Damian Green), I hope that we have taken a step back and recognised more  rightly where the parameters should lie.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">John Hemming: </span>Would my hon. Friend agree that as the  legislation aimed to protect whistleblowing, given that MPs are the  whistleblowers of last resort, there should be greater protection of  disclosures to MPs?</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon:</span> I  absolutely agree. The role of an MP is to be an advocate of last resort. We all  know that people come to us when they do not know where else to turn.  Sometimes, sadly, they come to us too late, when there is nothing that we can  do. Sometimes we see in our surgeries cases about which we think, &quot;If only  they had come a bit sooner, we might have been able to act.&quot; I had that  happen with a farmer in my constituency who had been made bankrupt by the time  he came to see me, by which time it was too late to do anything for him. My  hon. Friend is absolutely right. Because of the nature of an MP's work, and the  nature of the contact between a constituent who has a grievance and the MP, we  should get extra protection.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I mentioned that I would speak about parliamentary  privilege, or the right of MPs to speak up for and defend the British people. A  quite different case involved an approach made to me by people who were  concerned about what was happening at the Manchester College of Arts and  Technology, or MANCAT, as it is better known. They approached me in my capacity  as a member of the Public Accounts Committee and because of my known  predilection for detestation, if one can have a predilection for detestation-my  known dislike of the waste of public money might be a better way of putting it.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The case involved MANCAT, which has subsequently merged with  City College Manchester, and basically concerned investigations into management  practices which had been hampered because MANCAT officials were alleged to have  destroyed auditable documents and had reached financial settlements with  certain ex-members of staff on the condition that they signed confidentiality  agreements-gagging clauses-in their settlement agreements, which were obviously  paid for with public money.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The point at issue was that staff felt that they were  under pressure from the college to falsify student attendance registers and  other funding-related paperwork in order to enable MANCAT to claim extra money  from the then Learning and Skills Council. Indeed, one witness was planning to  explain the extent of the malpractice at an employment tribunal where she had  been in the process of seeking redress for constructive dismissal, but she was  offered a financial settlement with a gagging clause, so she could not easily  take the matter further.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">As a result of the privilege granted to Members of  Parliament, I was able to draw those  matters to public attention in two Adjournment debates over a period of months. <em>The Guardian</em> later wrote an article on 27 January 2009. It was headed,  &quot;College faces fraud claims&quot; and sub-headed, &quot;A Manchester  institution stands accused of altering registers to claim extra funding,  reports Andrew Mourant&quot;. In my view, and I suspect in the view of most  hon. Members, such matters should be brought to public attention. My point is  that that would not have been possible without parliamentary privilege and the  right of Members of Parliament to speak up for and to defend the British  people. That is why I feel so strongly about the matter.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr William Cash</span> <em>(Stone) (Con): </em>I totally and absolutely  endorse what my hon. Friend is saying. I was much involved in the Damian Green  affair-</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Peter Bone</span> <em>(in  the Chair): </em>Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member. I know that we  sometimes refer to the Damian Green affair, but we should refer to the hon.  Member for Ashford.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Cash: </span>I accept your point, Mr Bone, and will refer to the  matter of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford. Does the Minister worry that  there are moves afoot to adjust, in the light of political correctness, the  so-called role of the Member of Parliament and degrade it? Are they not missing  the biggest wood for the biggest trees by not realising that the Member of  Parliament, who is elected by voters and who, if given privilege and using it  responsibly, is the best possible defence for the right of the individual to  obtain the protection that they need through that privilege, not for our sake  but for theirs?</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon: </span>My hon.  Friend is absolutely right, and that is why I labour the point that  &quot;privilege&quot; is an unfortunate word. It is better to speak of the  right of Members of Parliament to speak up for and to defend the British  people, because that is what we are talking about. My hon. Friend is right that  those who want to chisel away at the rights of Members of Parliament are  chiselling away at the rights of the British people.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">At the time of the arrest of my hon. Friend the Member  for Ashford, I received a number of e-mails from people who were under the  impression that I, as a Member of Parliament, thought that some people,  including Members of Parliament, should be able to break the law, and that we  were somehow above the law. That was another aspect of the unfortunate phrase,  &quot;parliamentary privilege&quot;, because that is how they had understood  it. It surprised me-I had always understood it in the terms used by my hon.  Friend the Member for Stone-to realise that the majority of people had put a  completely different connotation on it. My hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the  House is listening to this debate, and perhaps Parliament should consider the  whole question of what we call such things. It is misleading, and it is  important that we understand what we are talking about.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">One of the stupidest things I ever heard a journalist say  was when someone was defending The Daily Telegraph sting, when Members of  Parliament were secretly recorded in their surgeries. I thought that that was  an outrage, as did many other people, including many in the media who thought  that it was a step too far. I did not catch the journalist's name, but when  trying to defend the sting he said on the radio, &quot;Well it's not exactly  the confessional.&quot; I remember thinking at the time, as I shouted at the  radio, as we sometimes do, that that is exactly what it is.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">All Members of Parliament know that it is a fairly common  experience for people to come to our surgeries and to burst into tears. Last  time that happened to me was the week before last, not last week, but two weeks  ago. It happens quite frequently, because when dealing with constituents, we  are often dealing with them as an advocate of last resort when they have  nowhere else to turn. Sometimes they come with a supporter-a friend-to help  them, because they do not know whether they will get through it and whether the  Member of Parliament will be helpful or a scary and intimidating figure of  authority.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I have had people come to see me who looked completely  balanced and calm, and in full possession of their faculties, only to discover  when I said the wrong thing that I triggered a wave of emotion about things  that had happened to them. From being perfectly collected, the constituent  would suddenly break down in tears. It is exactly a confessional. I can think  of a range hypersensitive cases at my surgeries involving child custody,  marital breakdown, allegations of paedophilia, armed robbery, allegations of  corruption, and so on, and other hon. Members will have had similar experience.  Our ability to help people in desperate situations is what we want to protect.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Cash:</span> Does my  hon. Friend accept that journalists are liable to be at the rough end of this,  because of certain aspects of investigative orders, European arrest warrants  and so on? Here we go again on the European issue. The plain fact is that the  defences that are available through Members of Parliament to protect the public  include invasion from external legal requirements that are imposed on us and  undermine our ability to carry out our duties. That includes the Bill of Rights  and a whole raft of other things. People may find that funny, but it is deadly  serious, and the more they laugh, the more stupid they look.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon:</span> I would  never say of my hon. Friend, &quot;There he is, going on about the European  issue again&quot;, and I certainly do not intend to do so today. He is right.  What exercised me most in the recent debate that the Backbench Business  Committee held in the main Chamber on prisoners voting was not whether  prisoners should have a vote but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for  Haltemprice and Howden said in that debate-sadly, he is not in his place at the  moment-the second of the two main points at issue. The first was whether  prisoners should have a vote; the second was who should decide. As he pointed  out at the time-I subsequently read the judgment of the European Court of Human  Rights-the court misinformed itself. It said things in its judgment about why  it thought prisoners in the UK should have a vote that were factually  inaccurate. I have a lot of sympathy with what my hon. Friend the Member for  Stone says.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">I do not want to detain the House much longer, except  to say that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley said at the  outset, if Parliament is blinded or deafened by the acts of others, it cannot  see or hear all grievances, and it is very clear from the Bill of Rights that  one of our purposes is to be able to see and hear all grievances-I emphasise  &quot;all grievances&quot;-and to do something about them. If Parliament cannot  see or hear all grievances, it cannot seek to remedy them.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">The whole development of English constitutional thought  owes a great deal to the word &quot;remedy&quot;. The history of administrative  law in this country and how it has grown over the past 300 years shows that the  seeking of a remedy was the point at issue. When our constituents come to us  with a grievance, they are seeking a remedy. The connection and the  relationship between us and our constituents is a sacrament. It is something  that we must work hard to protect; it is not something that we can take for  granted. We must uphold it, cherish it, and protect the right of Members of  Parliament to speak up for and to defend the British people.</p>
