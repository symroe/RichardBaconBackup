		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in 
			the House of Commons on
			7 July 2003</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk): </b>I, too, am 
		interested in money. The Chancellor spent most of his speech boasting 
		about it, as did the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie). In the 
		health service, much money is wasted: approximately £1 billion to £3 
		billion on fraud and theft; approximately £2 billion through bed 
		blocking and late cancelled operations; approximately £2 billion through 
		staff sicknesses and absences; approximately £1 billion through 
		infections that are caught while in hospital; between £300 million and 
		£600 million on over-prescribing drugs; approximately £400 million 
		through clinical negligence, and approximately £230 million on treating 
		patients who become malnourished while they are in hospital. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">That is a total of some £9 billion, which means 
		that between 16 per cent. and 20 per cent. of the NHS budget is wasted. 
		Those are Department of Health figures.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Eric Martlew (Carlisle):</b> Will the hon. 
		Gentleman give way? </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>No, I 
		do not have time. Before examining and boasting about extra expenditure, 
		we should discuss serious, proper financial management of it. The 
		Government are good at playing fast and loose with taxpayers' money. I 
		recently came across an example of a farmer who succeeded in claiming 
		two different subsidies under the arable area payments scheme and the 
		fibre flax scheme for the same piece of land. He also claimed for 
		territories which, on closer inspection, when people could be bothered 
		to examine the grid references that he had supplied, turned out to be in 
		the North sea between Scotland and Denmark and on the mainland of 
		Greenland and Iceland. Basic management, not targets, is what is needed 
		to deal with that.&nbsp; The reason why £4 billion-worth of Apache helicopters 
		are sitting in a shed on Salisbury plain is not targets but sheer 
		mismanagement and forgetting to train the pilots in time. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We have a chief 
		executive in the health service who was sacked and paid £149,000 in 
		compensation. Most of the payment was found to be ultra vires and it 
		should have been possible to reclaim it, but the six-year time limit had 
		elapsed and it could not be claimed back. The individual was 
		subsequently hired elsewhere in the NHS and later summoned to an 
		industrial tribunal to answer allegations of sexual harassment. He did 
		not turn up and was therefore sacked. However, as any lawyer would tell 
		us, it is unlawful to sack someone for not turning up to an industrial 
		tribunal, so the individual received a further £195,000 in compensation. 
		We do not need targets, but basic management. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">A classic example of 
		poor application of targets and its consequences is education. Let us 
		consider the halcyon days of 2001-02, when the Department for Education 
		and Skills underspent its budget by £1.7 billion and £6 billion was 
		underspent throughout the public sector. It is a shame that the Economic 
		Secretary is not present because he was the Minister with responsibility 
		for adult skills at the time of individual learning accounts, which were 
		a model of how not to do something and showed why targets by themselves 
		do not work. The cost was £300 million. Much, possibly even most - the 
		Department cannot say - was wasted. Seventy civil servants are spending 
		two years trying to sort out the mess, which was caused by targets. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In a unanimous 
		report, the Select Committee on Education and Skills stated: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;It should have been possible to design a 
				scheme to encourage new providers that was not wide open to 
				abuse by unscrupulous people posing as learning providers, but 
				the lack of quality assurance made it almost inevitable that it 
				would be abused.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Subsequently, the 
		Public Accounts Committee examined the individual learning accounts 
		scheme. Its report stated: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;In the absence of quality assurance, the 
				decision to give a positive incentive to providers to recruit 
				learners was fundamentally flawed.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">In other words, the 
		fraudsters envisaged easy pickings and came steaming in. The PAC report 
		continued: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Because of ineffective monitoring, the 
				Department was not aware of unusual patterns of activity, 
				including very large payments to individual providers&quot;. </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">The permanent 
		secretary to the Department, Mr. David Normington, said that the large 
		amount of activity on the individual learning accounts scheme was taken 
		as a sign of success. The Department budgeted £199 million for two 
		years, but it was spending three times that rate: £25 million a month, 
		which is a total of £600 million over two years. It did not realise that 
		it in spending that money it was being diddled and defrauded. It 
		believed that it was a sign of success. There was no control of cash. In 
		evidence to the Education and Skills Committee, the Economic Secretary, 
		who was formerly responsible for adult skills, said: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;At the moment because of the uncertain 
				number of individual learning account discount payments we are 
				going to have to pay we simply cannot give you a sense, even a 
				ballpark I regret to say, of what the possible overspends are 
				going to be.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">There was a complete 
		lack of financial control, yet the Chancellor had the gall to boast 
		about spending extra money. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">How did the Government get into such a mess? They 
		were genuinely interested not in quality but in quantity - never mind the quality, feel the width. The 
		Government had a manifesto target to include 1 million people in their 
		programme. As the Education and Skills Committee said of the individual 
		learning accounts scheme: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Presented with a manifesto commitment, 
				and a single target of one million users, insufficient attention 
				was given both to the reasons for the previous rejection of an 
				ILA scheme and to ensuring that quantity was balanced by 
				quality.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">That is a perfect 
		example of too much emphasis on targets and not enough on information 
		for users of public services. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In the health 
		service, we need to enable people to understand what goes on in 
		hospitals and what happens to waiting lists and mortality rates, and let 
		them make the decisions. In schools, we need to enable people to 
		understand what is happening with class sizes, exam results and 
		university entrance performance and let them choose. Dare I say it, 
		parents should be given the money to enable them to make the decisions. 
		What we need to do is to diminish the emphasis on targets and increase 
		the emphasis on choice.<br>
