		<div class="asublist"><cite>Address to students of City College, Norwich at the degree-awarding ceremony, Norwich Cathedral, Saturday 25 October 2008.
</cite></div><div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>
			<p class="speechbody">May I start by saying thank you very much for 
			inviting me to speak to you on this special occasion in this 
			beautiful Cathedral to celebrate the achievements of the students of 
			City College.&nbsp; It is a great pleasure to be here. I feel 
			honoured to have been invited.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I was very struck while looking through the 
			list of graduates for today&#8217;s ceremony at just how wide is the range 
			of subjects which people receiving their awards this morning and 
			this afternoon have studied.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="speechbody">Everything from Early Childhood Studies to 
			Construction and Computing; from Sport-Health-and-Exercise to 
			Insurance; from English with Psychology to Marketing and Finance; 
			from Accounting to Adult Numeracy and Literacy; from Licensed Retail 
			Management and Music Practice to Electronic Engineering. And many, 
			many more.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">It is a risky thing for a politician to touch 
			on religion publicly at all. But it seems to me if one is going to 
			take this risk &#8211; which I am &#8211; then a cathedral is the right place to 
			do it.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I think the rich variety of effort and study 
			we are celebrating today tells us something, or should tell us 
			something, about how we should live our lives and, in particular, 
			how we should treat one another. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">In Colossians 12 it says:</p>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;Now there are varieties of gifts, but the 
			same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; 
			and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who 
			activates all of them in everyone&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
			<p class="speechbody">And it goes on to say: </p>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;Indeed, the body does not consist of one 
			member but of many. If the foot were to say, &#8216;Because I am not a 
			hand, I do not belong to the body&#8217;, that would not make it any less 
			a part of the body. And if the ear were to say, &#8216;Because I am not an 
			eye, I do not belong to the body&#8217;, that would not make it any less a 
			part of the body&#8221;. </p>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;If the whole body were an eye, where would 
			the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the 
			sense of smell be?...&#8221;</p>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;As it is, there are many members, yet one 
			body. The eye cannot say to the hand, &#8216;I have no need of you&#8217;, nor 
			again the head to the feet, &#8216;I have no need of you.&#8217; On the 
			contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are 
			indispensable, and those members of the body that we think less 
			honourable we clothe with greater honour, and our less respectable 
			members are treated with greater respect&#8221;.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">In Romans chapter 12, one of my favourite 
			parts of the bible, it puts it even more directly where it simply 
			says: &#8220;Having gifts that differ&#8230;let us use them&#8221;.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Well, that is what all the people gathered 
			here today are doing. Searching out for, working at and using the 
			gifts which they have been given. And to me that is worth 
			celebrating.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Another thing which strikes me about the 
			graduates today, apart from the range of subjects, is that we have 
			many mature students who have engaged in studying for qualifications 
			later in their lives, perhaps for a change of career, to embark on a 
			new direction in life, or perhaps after having had a family.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">And to me that is supremely worth celebrating. 
			It speaks of an attitude to life that I find tremendously admirable 
			&#8211; that it is never too late to try something new, that it is never 
			too late to get qualifications in a new area, how ever much one may 
			have missed out earlier on.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I would add one other thing about education. 
			It is worth remembering that while education is exceptionally 
			important, education takes many different forms, that academic 
			education is not the same as all education and, indeed, that 
			education by itself is not enough. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">As Calvin Coolidge said:</p>
			<p class="speechquote">&#8220;Nothing in the world can take the place of 
			Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than 
			unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius 
			is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of 
			educated derelicts. Determination and Persistence alone are 
			omnipotent&#8221;. </p>
			<p class="speechbody">To all of you graduating today, may I offer 
			my sincere congratulations on your achievements, my very good wishes 
			for the future, and my hope that in the months and years to come you 
			will find the determination and persistence to turn your dreams, 
			what ever they are, into reality.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Thank you very much.</p>
