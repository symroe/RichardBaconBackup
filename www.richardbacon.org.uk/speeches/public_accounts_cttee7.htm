			Commons on 23 October 2007 as part of the Public Accounts Committee 
			debate</cite></p>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> It is a pleasure to take 
		part in the debate. I have been a member of the Committee for six years, 
		and have seen a number of common themes emerge. I want to address just a 
		few of those themes, with particular reference to the reports mentioned 
		in the motion.<p class="speechbody">The first issue that I shall deal with&#8212;I hope that the 
		Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury will address this point in her 
		reply&#8212;was touched on by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire 
		(David Taylor) in his intervention on the hon. Member for Falmouth and 
		Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). The question is: what is the centre doing 
		to make sure that when projects are spread out across Whitehall 
		Departments and agencies, things actually happen? Obviously, there is 
		inherent tension between avoiding a situation in which the Treasury is 
		too involved, and tries to micro-manage matters that should be the 
		responsibility of Departments, and avoiding sitting back and watching a 
		Department make a mess of things with the taxpayers&#8217; money given to it 
		by the Treasury.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I have not had the pleasure of being a Treasury Minister and being 
		vexed by such issues&#8212;although I am sure that that is something that 
		history will correct in the fullness of time. I am sure that Treasury 
		Ministers worry very much about that tension between the centre and 
		departmental responsibility. The tendency has been to let Departments 
		sort things out. Some years ago, there was the fiasco of the individual 
		learning accounts&#8212;an adult training scheme with great intentions, which 
		was designed to help the most vulnerable, and which failed miserably. I 
		remember thinking, &#8220;Where was the Treasury?&#8221; Similarly, in the case of 
		the Rural Payments Agency&#8212;although I respect the fact that we are not 
		talking about that issue today, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#8212;it was for the 
		Department to sort out the issue. The Treasury left the Department to 
		it, and left it to bear the financial brunt, too.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Paddington health campus scheme was the subject of our ninth 
		report, and at the time I found myself thinking about not where the 
		Treasury involvement was, but where the Department of Health involvement 
		was, in relation to the local strategic health authority and the local 
		hospital trusts involved. The ostensible purpose of the scheme was to 
		merge the St. Mary&#8217;s NHS Trust and the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS 
		Trust. However, as conclusion (i) of our report said,</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The Paddington Health 
		Campus scheme, as proposed...was based on an inadequate Outline Business 
		Case, constructed without the benefit of input from doctors and nurses 
		as to the required clinical content.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">We went on to say, in conclusion (iii), that</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;It took several years 
		after the initial outline business case for the Campus partners to reach 
		a clear position on the clinical content of the Campus, the land 
		required, the planning constraints and the likely cost and affordability 
		of the scheme. The scheme&#8217;s development was also handicapped by 
		insufficient manpower and capability. NHS Trusts taking forward building 
		schemes should have early external assessments...of their capacity to 
		deliver complex schemes and firm timetables against which they can 
		measure progress.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Treasury minutes responded:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Trusts are advised to 
		appoint a dedicated full-time project director and DH has established 
		specialist Project Director&#8217;s courses at selected universities. Proven, 
		high quality Project Directors are also deliberately moved to new 
		schemes so hard won experience and expertise is not wasted.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That is all very good, and I think that we all say amen to that. 
		However, the question is this: the Government may think that it is good 
		to have full-time project directors, and that they are necessary for 
		delivering projects successfully, but are they actually acting on that 
		in practice?</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That brings me to my second question, which is not so much about the 
		centre versus the local, but about whether we are getting the basics 
		right, at whatever level. Our 14th report was on delivering digital 
		communications through the Bowman programme. That was a so-called combat 
		infrastructure platform&#8212;a battlefield communications system. The project 
		was inherently complicated, because it sought to make sure that all the 
		different players in a battle, whether they were battle tanks, infantry 
		or air support, could talk to each other, and to HQ, and all that had to 
		be delivered properly. It was an extraordinarily complex project, yet it 
		did not have a senior responsible owner. It was not that the senior 
		responsible owners kept changing, as we have seen happen in many 
		projects; there just was not one at all. As our report concluded,</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;There is no individual 
		within the Department with full responsibility for ensuring that the 
		Bowman CIP&#8221;&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">combat infrastructure platform&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;project meets its 
		objectives. In 2006, the Department belatedly appointed a senior officer 
		to act as Senior Responsible Owner. But he lacks the authority and time 
		to effectively discharge this onerous responsibility and is only 
		supported by a small staff.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The Ministry of Defence, and subsequently the Treasury in its 
		minutes, concluded that that was an omission, and that</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;It is the Department&#8217;s 
		policy that large and complex projects or groups of projects have a 
		Senior Responsible Owner appointed on behalf of and accountable to the 
		Defence Management Board.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">It is a good idea to have project directors and senior responsible 
		owners in charge of projects, but even if a senior responsible owner is 
		in charge, is that enough? It would appear not, because our first 
		conclusion in our 27th report on IT-enabled business change, which was 
		referred to earlier, was that</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;A fifth (21 per cent.) 
		of Senior Responsible Owners of mission critical and high risk 
		IT-enabled programmes had not met with the nominated Minister and a 
		further 28 per cent. met the Minister less than once a quarter. For 
		these major high risk undertakings to succeed, Ministers need to be 
		briefed fully and candidly at least quarterly on risks, progress and 
		cost escalations&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In its reply, the Treasury states:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Ministers and 
		Accounting Officers should, in particular, be briefed when there is 
		significant deviation from the programme or project plan&#8212;that is, where 
		there is more than three months slippage&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I am bound to ask, why should Ministers not be briefed all the time? 
		Why should they be briefed only when there is slippage? Should not 
		Ministers know what is going on in mission-critical projects all the 
		time, whether they are going well or not? Why do Ministers not say, at 
		an early stage, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have a senior responsible owner?&#8221;?</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I remember talking to a Minister who was involved in one high-profile 
		case that the Committee considered&#8212;a typical IT project that had gone 
		wrong. I am sad to say that that Minister resigned, because he had the 
		wisdom to vote the right way on the Iraq war&#8212;that is to say, against&#8212;and 
		he could not do that and support the Government policy of the day. I am 
		glad to say that his career has been restored now; he is actually in the 
		Cabinet, so that may give hon. Members a clue as to who I am talking 
		about. I remember him saying, in respect of a particular project, &#8220;I sat 
		in a room, having listened to what people said, and having read about 
		the matter, and I said, &#8216;This isn&#8217;t going to work, is it?&#8217;&#8221; He said that 
		there were 12 people in the room&#8212;civil servants and consultants&#8212;and they 
		all said, &#8220;Oh yes, Minister, it will work.&#8221; He said that there was no 
		one in the room who said, &#8220;Well, actually, no. You&#8217;ve got a point; there 
		are some serious concerns.&#8221; There was no critical friend at court to 
		make sure that the concerns were given a serious airing and had a 
		serious voice, and as a result, he signed off the project. Of course, 
		his instincts and concerns were absolutely right, and the project hit 
		the buffers, just as so many others do.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In another case, I was talking to the senior computer contractor from 
		a major firm which has been involved in many of the projects that we 
		have examined, who was desperate to talk to the Minister to find out how 
		to resolve an impasse and get some clarity on direction, and finally 
		begged the Department for a meeting with the Minister. Within 10 minutes 
		of that request, the permanent secretary himself was on the phone 
		saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t talk to Ministers. We talk to Ministers.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">If I were a Minister&#8212;as I mentioned to the Exchequer Secretary 
		earlier, she does not seem to think that that is likely, but in the 
		fullness of time I very much hope that we will have the chance to put 
		into practice some of the things that we are talking about. It seems to 
		me essential for Ministers to find critical friends at court, who would 
		tell them not what they wanted to hear, but what they did not want to 
		hear. I am sure that the more intelligent and switched-on Ministers do 
		that. There is also the problem, as we heard earlier, of civil servants 
		not being able to get the access that they require to Ministers, as we 
		heard again in the context of the Rural Payments Agency.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">In relation to the 27th report, there was one answer from the 
		Treasury that I thought was particularly interesting. We said in our 
		conclusion (iii) that</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;over half of Senior 
		Responsible Owners (SROs) are in their first SRO role, and nearly half 
		spend less than 20 per cent. of their time on such duties.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Lack of time was a key factor in some of the other projects that we 
		looked at. We went on to say:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Lack of relevant 
		experience, combined with a regular turnover of post-holders, adds 
		unnecessary risk to the management of IT-enabled change.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">We said:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;To address these 
		issues, departments should appoint a Senior Responsible Owner at the 
		outset of an IT-enabled business change on the presumption that he or 
		she will remain in post until the programme or project is delivered, 
		with performance and reward linked to agreed targets and milestones.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>David Taylor:</b> I shall not refer to the RPA, as that report is 
		not under discussion, but I worked on major IT projects for almost 30 
		years before coming to this place, and does the hon. Gentleman agree 
		that one of the common themes with major IT project failures is that the 
		client Department needs to be an intelligent client, and it cannot be an 
		intelligent client if it outsources virtually every aspect of the 
		development of computer systems? It needs to have its own internal 
		trusted, experienced people, who can balance out the glowing reports 
		given by the would-be supplier of the software.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> I completely agree. I remember the then chairman of 
		the Inland Revenue, as it was then, Sir Nick Montagu, fiercely denying 
		what was plain to everybody else&#8212;that the Inland Revenue had ceased to 
		be an intelligent client, because so much of its sourcing function and 
		its buying function was spread out among different consultancies that it 
		was only one or two of the consulting firms that had an overview of what 
		was going on. The Inland Revenue was no longer capable of answering the 
		intelligent questions that one wanted to ask, because too much of its 
		expertise was outsourced.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I was talking about the appointment of a senior responsible owner, 
		and the presumption that the SRO would remain in post until the project 
		was seen through. The interesting thing was the Government&#8217;s answer in 
		the Treasury minute, in which the Treasury says:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The Government agrees 
		that continuity of leadership is of critical importance&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That is in paragraph 11, on page 3 of the minute on the 27th report. 
		However, the next sentence states:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Although the natural 
		progression of civil servants between roles may mean that a project has 
		more than one SRO during its lifetime, the expectation should be that 
		the SRO should change only when absolutely necessary, at appropriate 
		stages to allow an orderly handover, and that the SRO will not move on 
		until a replacement has been put in place.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That is common sense, but why does the natural progression of civil 
		servants between roles mean that a project should have more than one SRO? 
		Why should not the SRO finish the project, deliver it and then get the 
		natural progression to the next post in their career? Unless and until 
		they have completed the project, they should not have a natural 
		progression. If that means paying civil servants more in post, so be it.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I know that I am not talking rubbish about this, because I have heard 
		Sir Peter Gershon, and before him various other civil servants, talking 
		about the need to reward civil servants who stay in post to see projects 
		through. Yet here we have the Treasury saying:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;the natural progression 
		of civil servants between roles may mean that a project has more than 
		one SRO&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I say that the SRO should see the thing through. The project should 
		be short enough for one SRO to deliver it. It should be done in 
		bite-size chunks that can be delivered. That is one of the central 
		problems that we face in getting an improvement across Government.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman think that one of 
		the reasons why civil servants may move on is that projects tend to 
		overrun for so long that if they stayed for the duration, civil servants 
		might be claiming their pension by the time the project was finished?</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> The hon. Lady probably has a point. No matter where 
		a project stands and how well developed it may or may not be, the 
		culture of the civil service says, &#8220;Come on, Carruthers, your two and a 
		half years are up. It&#8217;s time for you to get some more experience. You&#8217;re 
		going to be transferred to the Cabinet Office&#8221;&#8212; or to stamping passports 
		in Tristan da Cunha, depending on how well or badly he has done. That is 
		valued more highly than the delivery of a project. I do not think that 
		the delivery of a project has enough value inside Whitehall.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">There is an explanation for that, which is unfortunate. Delivery of a 
		project is not what causes civil servants to do well, because in a 
		Darwinian sense it is not highly enough valued. What is highly valued is 
		the ability to 
		get Ministers out of a hole&#8212;I do not blame the present Government; I 
		think this is universal with Governments of all parties&#8212;and to help 
		Ministers explain why things that look like a disaster are &#8220;the best 
		that we can possibly have done, considering the difficult combination of 
		circumstances with which we were faced, Minister.&#8221; A civil servant who 
		can do that will prosper. That is the fault of politicians, not civil 
		servants.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Leigh:</b> And until recently, not a single project director 
		had ever become a permanent secretary.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> That is a scandal. We must start changing the 
		culture and valuing the delivery of projects, and that requires changes 
		on the part of politicians, so that Ministers are not trying simply to 
		grab a quick headline, but to deliver commitments and see them through. 
		That is probably as difficult for the present Labour Government as it 
		will be for a future Conservative Government. It is a fundamental and 
		inherent problem in delivering good government.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I shall refer to one more thing in the Treasury minutes on the 
		report. We had said in recommendation (ix):</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The Office of 
		Government Commerce and the Delivery and Transformation Group have not 
		had the power to halt failing programmes and projects. The Treasury&#8217;s 
		new Major Projects Review Group will however be reviewing all new 
		business cases for high risk or mission critical programmes&#8221;.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">For some years I have wanted to see some central capacity&#8212;some power 
		at the centre&#8212; to say, &#8220;You&#8217;ve failed. No more money. We&#8217;re pulling the 
		plug.&#8221; It seems obvious that that power should sit in the Treasury, but 
		the Treasury minute answering that point, paragraph 21, says not that 
		the Treasury will have that power, but rather that</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The Government agrees 
		that the MPRG should make it clear to Departmental project owners what 
		they need to do to address its concerns.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">There is enormous fear of greater interference. I appreciate that 
		there are people saying that there is too much interference from the 
		centre with Departments, just as there is from Departments down across 
		the country&#8212;but one of my first points, which I hope the Exchequer 
		Secretary will address, is whether the balance is right. We do not want 
		huge amounts of intervention. We want the right intervention and the 
		right power at the right time at the centre. I am not convinced that we 
		have got that balance right.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">My next point, which is related, is that the same problems occur 
		again and again. In our 31st report on the Government&#8217;s use of 
		consultants is a good example. We said in recommendation (ii):</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Departments and OGC do 
		not routinely know how much money is spent on consultants&#8221;,</p>
		<p class="speechbody">in recommendation (iii):</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Consultants are often 
		used when in-house staff have the necessary skills and are less 
		expensive&#8221;,</p>
		<p class="speechbody">in recommendation (iv):</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Departments do not 
		routinely assess the value of the work they receive from consultants&#8221;,</p>
		<p class="speechbody">in recommendation (v):</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The capability of 
		departments to be intelligent customers&#8221;&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;is weakened by 
		insufficient sharing of information on consultants&#8217; performance&#8221;,</p>
		<p class="speechbody">and in recommendation (vi) that</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;40 per cent of clients 
		consider they have used consultants when it was not necessary.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">We said in recommendation (viii):</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Departments do not 
		regularly plan for, or achieve, the transfer of skills from consultants 
		to their staff to build internal capabilities&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">and in recommendation (ix):</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;Some consultant charges 
		lack transparency&#8221;,</p>
		<p class="speechbody">and so on.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The interesting thing is that not only were all those recommendations 
		and the themes relating to them clearly identified in our Committee&#8217;s 
		2002 report on better value for money from professional services&#8212;we make 
		this point in our recommendation (i), which the Treasury refers to in 
		its minute in reply on page 31&#8212;but the Cabinet Office identified those 
		problems in a study which its own scrutiny unit did eight years 
		previously, in 1994. It stated clearly that the Government were poor at 
		identifying when consultants should be used, poor at appointing them, 
		poor at project management during the process, poor at transferring 
		skills to in-house staff and poor at learning lessons for the future.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">None of this is new at all, which is why I asked the Exchequer 
		Secretary about the tension between the centre and the local and the 
		centre and the Department, and about whether, without being heavy-handed 
		or bureaucratic, things can be done to improve that balance. I hope that 
		she will find time to address that issue specifically.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I have been reading Michael Barber&#8217;s book &#8220;Instruction to Deliver&#8221;, 
		in which he discusses the need to improve Departments&#8217; performance, in 
		an environment in which the Treasury would not co-operate. He refers to 
		Sir David Normington, who is now at the Home Office, telling him about 
		the problems that he would face. The Treasury would shut him out, 
		permanent secretaries would neither talk to him nor give him information 
		and he would not be able to get to the Prime Minister&#8212;then Mr. 
		Blair&#8212;because the policy unit would be in the way. That meant that he 
		would probably be finished before he even started, so he had to think 
		about how to get round the situation. He proposed a series of simple 
		measures and behaviours to be adhered to&#8212;including, by the way, 
		abolishing the delivery unit after a few years. He thought that that 
		would help to improve its performance, and I think that in some ways it 
		did. The whole story illustrates a vexing and long-term problem in the 
		nature of how we govern ourselves, and I would be interested in the 
		Exchequer Secretary&#8217;s thoughts on that.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">Finally, I want to say a quick word about the BBC. I see no good 
		reason why it should not be subject to the same degree, quality and type 
		of scrutiny as other bodies that undertake public expenditure. The 
		criticism that it, an important national institution, has come in for 
		recently may be down to the fact that it has not had enough of the right 
		scrutiny early enough. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Falmouth and 
		Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) is no longer in her place, because a good 
		example of BBC extravagance took place in her constituency, when Dame 
		Ellen MacArthur arrived back from sailing around the world. We are all 
		familiar with BBC producers turning up to cover the same event; I have 
		asked people, as a party game, how many BBC producers they think turned 
		up to cover the return of Dame Ellen. They usually say five, 10, 15, 20 
		or even 30&#8212;but in fact 64 BBC producers were there. With the best will 
		in the world&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b> Order. The hon. 
		Gentleman is going a little far from the brief that is before the House; 
		I suggest that he steer his way back.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> I shall steer away from those rip tides, Mr. Deputy 
		Speaker, but I hope that the Exchequer Secretary will think about that 
		issue, because I know that other Members, including the right hon. 
		Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams), are concerned about it.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I shall make one other point before concluding. The Public Accounts 
		Committee&#8217;s 20th report on the national programme for IT stated on page 
		viii:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;We are concerned in 
		particular that iSOFT&#8217;s flagship software product, &#8216;Lorenzo&#8217;&#8212;on which 
		three fifths of the Programme depends&#8212;is not yet available despite 
		statements by the company in its 2005 Annual report that the product was 
		available from early 2004.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The software company said that the product would be available, but 
		still it was not. Paragraph 33 of the Treasury response stated:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;The Lorenzo product is 
		expected to be available during 2008.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I will not dwell on the issue, because I am a bit bored with making 
		well-researched and informed speeches on the national programme for IT 
		in the health service, only for Ministers to say things that are 
		manifest nonsense. I shall not encourage the Exchequer Secretary to say 
		something that is probably not true; all I ask is that she, or one of 
		her colleagues, will come to the House to inform us when the Lorenzo 
		product becomes available. I do not think that paragraph 33 is true; 
		time will tell us that.</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I said that I would refer only to paragraph 33, but I should also 
		refer to recommendation 4, one of the most important of our report. It 
		stated:</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&#8220;In view of the slippage 
		in the deployment of local systems, the Department should also 
		commission an urgent independent review of the performance of Local 
		Service Providers against their contractual obligations.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The purpose of that recommendation was to help the Treasury and 
		central Government in their battle against computer contractors. Such an 
		independent review would show that the local service providers had 
		failed in respect of a whole panoply of contractual obligations into 
		which they had entered, and make it much easier to unravel the contracts 
		without huge cost to the taxpayer.<br>
