			<span lang="EN">Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</span></b><span lang="EN"> 
			I am glad to have the opportunity to raise the case of Sarah Lynch. 
			The case was originally taken up several years ago by my hon. Friend 
			the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) when Sarah's parents, Mike 
			and Sally Lynch, lived in his constituency, but it became my 
			responsibility when they moved into my South Norfolk constituency. 
			Quite simply, the case concerns their 20-year struggle to get an 
			adequate explanation for the severe cerebral injuries that were 
			sustained by their new-born child while she was in the care of the 
			Royal Brompton hospital.
			</span>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I was grateful for the 
			opportunity to meet briefly the Minister of State, Department of 
			Health, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane 
			Kennedy), and her officials yesterday to explain at least the 
			background to the complex case. I appreciated that and I know that 
			Mr. and Mrs. Lynch did as well. I am delighted that my hon. Friend 
			the Member for Aylesbury has been able to join us for the debate. 
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">On 12 August 1983, Sarah 
			Kathleen Lynch was born at Wycombe general hospital. She was the 
			elder child of twins. Although no problems had been detected with 
			Sarah, her mother, Sally, was not happy with her breathing or 
			feeding. Her mother eventually convinced herself that she was 
			overreacting and there was nothing to worry about, and Sarah was 
			discharged two weeks after her birth. However, concerns grew when 
			Sarah increasingly became unable to keep down food and lost weight.
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">In September 1983, Sarah was 
			diagnosed with a serious heart defect. After further tests at the 
			John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, she was admitted to the Royal 
			Brompton hospital under the care of Dr. Elliott Shinebourne, a 
			consultant paediatric cardiologist. On 4 October 1983, Sarah was 
			operated on by Mr. Christopher Lincoln, a consultant cardiac 
			surgeon. She underwent a cardiopulmonary bypass, which requires the 
			cooling of a patient's body. The procedure is complex and dangerous, 
			and Sarah had to be cooled to a temperature that slowed her heart 
			enough to allow surgery to proceed. It is worth saying at this point 
			that the cooling becomes important later in the story, as we shall 
			see. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">After the operation, Sarah's 
			condition was noted as &quot;fair&quot;. However, between 7.5 and 7.30 pm that 
			day, the south block of the hospital experienced a total electrical 
			power failure that lasted for approximately 15 minutes. 
			Unfortunately, the hospital's stand-by generator failed to provide 
			back-up power as its starter motor had malfunctioned. As a result, 
			Sarah was allegedly hand ventilated for the duration of the power 
			cut, although the hospital has been unable to identify who carried 
			out the hand ventilation. It is worth stressing that Mr. and Mrs. 
			Lynch were not told about the power failure and discovered that it 
			had occurred only some three years later. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">An undated discharge summary 
			noted that Sarah was transferred to Wycombe general hospital for 
			convalescence on 15 October 1983 and was deemed to be &quot;in good 
			condition.&quot; In late November 1983, concern was expressed about 
			Sarah's neurological status. It is worth saying that there is no 
			evidence that a neurologist was involved in the case at any stage - on 
			behalf of the hospital at any rate - even though there was, as it 
			turned out, severe brain damage. A computerised tomography scan was 
			performed and it confirmed that Sarah had suffered not only severe 
			brain damage, but, as a result of that, spastic quadriplegia, focal 
			epilepsy, severe motor impairment, developmental delay and near 
			total blindness. As Dr. Richard Newton, a 
			consultant in child and adolescent neurology and one of the medical 
			experts who examined the case later on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Lynch, 
			put it, as a result of her time in hospital, </span></p>

			&quot;Sarah is . . . totally dependent on others for all her needs. Her 
			abilities are not more than those of a new born baby and will remain 
			so throughout her life&quot;.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Sarah started having fits and 
			spent much of the next two years in and out of hospital. In 1986, 
			the Lynch family received a questionnaire from Mr. Lincoln, the 
			surgeon who had undertaken the operation, asking <i>[Interruption.]</i> 
			I hope that the Minister will listen to this point because it is 
			quite important. The questionnaire asked whether Sarah could perform 
			sports, whether she tired easily and what activities she was unable 
			to perform. The parents found the questionnaire extraordinary. Given 
			that Sarah required 24-hour attention and could not walk, talk or 
			feed herself, and given that the hospital should have been aware of 
			those facts, it was an acutely insensitive thing to do and casts 
			considerable doubt on the hospital's procedures. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The questionnaire and the fact 
			that the hospital had sent it when it should have known of Sarah's 
			condition also led the family, which, frankly, for the previous two 
			years had been struggling on a daily basis to cope with the 
			consequences of her injuries and had been in and out of hospital all 
			the time, to conclude that the time had come to ask for further and 
			broader answers on what had happened. They requested a meeting with 
			Mr. Lincoln and Dr. Shinebourne. It took place in January 1987, but 
			it failed to convince Mr. and Mrs. Lynch that the hospital had not 
			been negligent in Sarah's treatment. In April that year, Sally Lynch 
			began legal proceedings against the Royal Brompton on Sarah's 
			behalf, citing severe irreparable damage and loss. Sadly, Sarah 
			Lynch died aged 11 on 10 February 1995. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The Royal Brompton's failings 
			cover nearly every aspect of Sarah's time in the hospital and long 
			after her discharge. The Lynches felt that they were not informed of 
			the true nature of the risks inherent in the procedure, only the 
			risks of not operating on Sarah, and thus agreed to go ahead with 
			it. In a letter dated 2 February 1987 to Dr. Fleet, paediatric 
			consultant at Wycombe hospital, where Sarah was convalescing, Mr. 
			Lincoln states that after their meeting, the Lynches had given him

			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">When legal action commenced in 
			1987, the hospital failed to disclose relevant records, only 
			revealing their loss or destruction in an affidavit sworn by the 
			hospital's general manager in August 1989. The affidavit confirmed 
			that no search for nursing observations for the post-operative 
			period was undertaken until 1988 and that the generator's 
			maintenance logbook was destroyed in 1987. To date, Sarah's X-ray 
			plates and reports have never been found. One would have thought—I 
			made this point to the Minister yesterday—that for such cutting-edge 
			and risky procedures, it would be all the more important to have 
			meticulous record keeping so that in the event of an incident, or 
			simply in order to evaluate the effectiveness of procedures, the 
			hospital would be able to refer back accurately to what had happened 
			in any individual case. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I mentioned that the family 
			consulted a number of independent medical experts, which they did to 
			find out further information. They reviewed the case notes and

			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;The anaesthetic recording . . . is, in my opinion, very poor. There 
			are only five recordings of systolic blood pressure measured over 
			the period of some two and a quarter hours that the anaesthetic is 
			in progress. This is quite inadequate for such a major procedure&quot;.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Professor Robinson also refers 
			to Mr. Lincoln's letter of 2 February 1987, in which Mr. Lincoln 
			states that he had </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;rigorously studied all the operation notes and anaesthetic charts 
			and failed to pinpoint a cause for Sarah's brain damage.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Professor Robinson was 
			dubious, stating: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">&quot;I 
			believe this to be unlikely because I believe that it is obvious 
			from a rigorous examination of the anaesthetic record, the 
			perfusionist's records and the nursing notes that Mr. Lincoln cannot 
			have been led to that conclusion&quot;.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Mr. Keith Roberts, honorary 
			consultant cardiothoracic surgeon for the West Midlands regional 
			health authority, in examining Sarah's case, made exactly the same 
			point when he wrote in May 1990 that if these charts </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;are those made available to me I cannot see how a 'rigorous 
			examination' could have been made in view of the inadequacy of such 
			charts&quot;.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Mr. Roberts was scathing about 
			the record keeping, writing: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;The anaesthetic record is abysmally inadequate. Under 'Surgeon' the 
			initials 'EDS' appear. Does this mean that a Senior Registrar 
			actually did the operation with Mr Lincoln's assistance? There are 
			only four readings of blood pressure prior to bypass, the lowest 
			being 22 mm. mercury, and only one when bypass was resumed, of 42 
			mm. mercury. There is no record of temperature nor the time taken 
			over the period of surface cooling, nor what technique of surface 
			cooling was employed, nor the time at which the chest was opened. 
			This is a deplorable record—or rather, lack of recording.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The Royal College of 
			Anaesthetists' good practice guide states: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;In providing care you must keep clear, accurate, legible and 
			contemporaneous patient records which report the relevant clinical 
			findings, the decisions made, the information given to patients and 
			any drugs or other treatment prescribed. You must keep colleagues 
			well informed when sharing the care of patients&quot;.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The King's Fund organisation 
			audit hospital accreditation programme has set a standard for health 
			records in its organisational standards criteria which states:
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;There is an accurate health record which enables the patient to 
			receive effective continuing care, enables the healthcare team to 
			communicate effectively, allows another doctor or professional 
			members of staff to assume the care of the patient at any time, 
			enables the patient to be identified without risk or error, 
			facilitates the collection of data for research, education and 
			audit&quot; - </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">the point that I made 
			yesterday -&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;and can be used in legal proceedings . . . If this standard of 
			record keeping is not maintained, and professional requirements are 
			not being met, patients are being put at risk . . . and patients' 
			rights, as set out in the Patients' Charter, are compromised. It 
			cannot be emphasised too strongly that in medico-legal cases the 
			outcome is often dependent on the anaesthetic record. An untidy, 
			illegible, scantily completed chart may be taken as indirect 
			evidence of shoddy or inattentive care.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Mr. Roberts had further 
			criticisms in relation to the cooling, which I mentioned at the 
			beginning of my remarks. In noting that the temperature for surface 
			cooling is not recorded, and that the temperature for bypass cooling 
			is not recorded, Mr. Roberts stated - this is an extraordinarily 
			important point:</span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">&quot;I 
			find this an extraordinary state of affairs, one with which I 
			personally would not carry out open heart surgery . . . It is highly 
			probable in this case that cooling occurred at too rapid a rate . . 
			. and cooling on bypass from a temperature of 21° C to 14° C in 2 
			minutes seems unduly rapid (almost impossible)!&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Of the power failure, Mr. 
			Roberts wrote: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;This to me indicates a terrible lack of back-up facility at the 
			Brompton hospital. In my own unit the cardiac operating theatre and 
			Intensive Care Unit have two separate sub-station supplies of 
			electricity, plus an emergency generator which cuts in after a ten 
			second delay and receives weekly maintenance checks. To carry out 
			cardiac surgery, particularly on infants who are particularly 
			vulnerable, without a guaranteed power supply, seems to me to be 
			irresponsible.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Dr. Richard Newton, a 
			neurologist who was consulted in May 1992 and who addressed the 
			specifics of the neurological damage, concluded: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;The management of the encephalopathic illness seems to have been 
			poorly thought out, and the medical team I believe were negligent in 
			not seeking advice on this aspect . . . I feel doctors did fail in 
			their duty, both in not explaining the risk of brain injury prior to 
			the surgery and also the significance of the post-operative events&quot;.</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">There is no evidence that a 
			neurologist was involved at any stage.  </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I now come to the report of 
			Dr. Dominic Bell. I mentioned to the Minister yesterday that this 
			report was very significant. It was a review of the whole case by an 
			independent fact-finder, commissioned and paid for by the Brompton 
			hospital. There were consultations, and all parties agreed to put 
			the matter before Dr. Bell, a consultant in intensive care and 
			anaesthesia at Leeds general infirmary, honorary senior lecturer at 
			the university of Leeds and a General Medical Council performance 
			assessor. It is worth pointing out that Dr. Bell's review was only 
			the latest of quite a few that had already been undertaken, at the 
			behest of the parents, by various independent medical experts. It 
			was not as though it came out of the blue; it was the culmination of 
			a series of independent reviews by medical experts. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Dr. Bell's remit was to 
			determine whether the family's grievance has any foundation in 
			sub-optimal or negligent practice; whether the grievance indicates a 
			shortfall in other professional responsibilities such as 
			communication, responsiveness and respect; whether the grievance has 
			been addressed in an acceptable manner; and whether the grievance 
			can be resolved. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Almost immediately, Dr. Bell's 
			investigation stalled, and he protested to the Brompton: </span></p>
			<span lang="EN"Almost immediately, Dr. Bell's

			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;Deriving the key component of causation is difficult when relevant 
			documentation from the clinical records is missing, staff are 
			untraceable, and the involved medical practitioners consider 
			post-operative events in ICU to have played no part but can identify 
			no intra-operative problems as causal either.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">In essence, the position being 
			taken by the Brompton was that the power failure could not even 
			potentially have been a contributory cause of the brain injury, but 
			it was not able to explain what was the contributory cause.  </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">On completion of his 
			preliminary report in October 2001, Dr. Bell came under considerable 
			pressure from the Brompton to moderate the tone of his report, to 
			alter its formatting and to change his interpretation. He was 
			sufficiently concerned by the attitude of the Brompton to place 
			correspondence in the hands of his defence organisation, the Medical 
			Defence Union, which advised him: </span></p>

			&quot;You could be left fairly vulnerable if you produce a final version

			final report is not influenced by the Trust, otherwise your status 
			as an 'independent' expert may be questioned by the family.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Dr. Bell replied to the trust 
			expressing his disappointment that the trust's attitude was not 
			lending itself to resolving the family's grievance and refusing to 
			alter his position. His final report was issued in March 2003 and 
			was severely critical of the Brompton at almost every level. He 
			found that there was no evidence of any attempt to discuss the 
			nature and origins of Sarah's neurological problems, the outlook, 
			her care needs or planned management. He found that there was a 
			complete failure to provide appropriate information to the parents, 
			stating: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;One is not left with a favourable impression on standards of 
			communication, empathy and sense of responsibility.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">He found that the Brompton had 
			failed to launch an inquiry into the power failure and notes that 
			despite previous failures of activation of the emergency generator 
			there were no protocols in place to direct nursing and medical 
			action in the event of a failure of the power supply.  </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Dr. Bell puts forward the

			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">No amount of fine words can 
			bring back Sarah—words from me, the Minister or from anyone else. I 
			have been struck by the determination of the Lynch family to 
			discover exactly what happened to their daughter Sarah and to expose 
			the failures of the Royal Brompton hospital. The hospital failed 
			fully to inform desperately worried parents of the true nature of 
			the serious operation that their child was to undertake. It failed 
			also to enforce rigorous standards of record keeping by allowing 
			clinical staff to make only the most perfunctory of entries in 
			medical records without regard to their accuracy. Crucially, it 
			failed to ensure that there was a standby generator that was fit for 
			purpose to support the hospital in the event of a power failure. 
			Indeed, a note of 18 October 1983 from the hospital's general 
			manager confirms that the standby generator had not only failed on 4 
			October 1983 but had failed on at least one other occasion.  </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The hospital had allowed vital 
			records pertaining to an extremely serious case to be destroyed or 
			mislaid. It provided only the minimum assistance necessary to the 
			Lynches' efforts to uncover the truth, showing that the hospital's 
			management did not understand the distress that their actions have 
			caused. It agreed to consult an independent fact finder in the 
			person of Dr. Dominic Bell, only to pressurise him into altering his 
			conclusions and ignoring unfavourable findings. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The majority of the hospital's 
			failings were just as indefensible in 1983 as they would be today. 
			It is not simply a case of, &quot;We know better now.&quot; The hospital 
			should have known better then, in 1983. I would be the first to 
			applaud the excellent pioneering work that the Royal Brompton 
			hospital has done in the field of cardiac surgery. I am sure that 
			the Minister will agree that the standards of treatment given to 
			Sarah Lynch are not befitting of that institution. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">However, given the Royal 
			Brompton's continued stonewalling, and its obvious disdain for 
			independent reports and expert opinions, the best way forward is a 
			full public inquiry. There are serious problems with such an 
			inquiry, which can best be summarised as time, money and lawyers. I 
			accept that the Minister may have serious reservations about a 
			public inquiry, but if one were instigated it would not simply be an 
			inquiry into the case of Sarah Lynch. There are wide-ranging 
			problems with cardiac services in the UK. I was not aware of it 
			until recently, because I was concentrating on Mr. and Mrs. Lynch's 
			case, but in August 1999, Mr. Ken Livingstone, then the Member for 
			Brent, East, called for a public inquiry because of widespread 
			concerns about failures at the Royal Brompton. The Bristol royal 
			infirmary inquiry was under way, and 40 or so parents went to the 
			hospital's family support group for advice and assistance. A 
			whistleblower from the Royal Brompton hospital contacted the 
			inquiry, and their evidence was referred back to the Royal Brompton, 
			which led it to launch its own investigation. It appointed two 
			cardiologists, who reported that there was nothing untoward. They 
			tried to keep their work confidential, but it was reported in the 
			press in August 1999, and many parents became agitated, because 
			their cases were not considered in the review. At the moment that 
			the review was concluded, therefore, a new one was announced to look 
			at the issues affecting other parents. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">We should consider, too, the 
			question of what may have happened at the John Radcliffe hospital in 
			Oxford. In November 2004, <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> reported that 
			there was higher than expected incidence of mortality in paediatric 
			cardiac care at that hospital. The Healthcare Commission refused to 
			entertain the notion of looking further into the issue, but the 
			Minister will know that that is no longer the case. In a report that 
			was published only last week on 5 January 2006 and appears on the 
			commission's website, patients and local people were asked to 
			comment on their experiences of the adult cardiothoracic services 
			provided by the John Radcliffe hospital surgery unit, which is part 
			of the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust, because of </span>
			</span>
			<span lang="EN"></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;concerns raised through the analysis of recent data and by previous 
			reviews about the quality of care at the unit.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The Minister will know that 
			the standardised mortality rate at the John  Radcliffe is twice the 
			national average. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Four years ago, following the 
			Bristol royal infirmary scandal, there was a public inquiry and 
			recommendations were made. The report was 30 or 40 pages long, and 
			made 198 recommendations, one of which was that the provision of 
			cardiac services should be concentrated in fewer, more specialist 
			centres, where surgeons would perform a greater number of 
			operations, because it was thought that someone who does 50 or 100 
			operations a year will perform them better than someone who performs 
			only a small number. The Government have explicitly rejected that 
			recommendation. In a reply to my hon. Friend the Member for South 
			Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), the right hon. Member for Airdrie and 
			Shotts (John Reid), who was then Secretary of State, refused to 
			adopt the recommendation in the Kennedy report for the Bristol 
			inquiry because </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;it would require us to close some of the most successful cardiac 
			centres in the country&quot;.—[<i>Official Report</i>, 20 January 2004; 
			Vol. 416, c. 1208.]</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Plainly, there will be a 
			tension, as the Minister will be aware, between a concentrated 
			expertise-driven approach and a devolved approach. However, that was 
			only one of nearly 200 recommendations, so it would be timely and 
			interesting to consider what progress has been made on the rest. In 
			an article in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, Dr. Paul Aylin and 
			others looked at paediatric cardiac surgical mortality in England 
			after Bristol, and in their final paragraph they concluded 
			optimistically: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;Mortality at the Bristol Royal Infirmary has fallen markedly after 
			the changes there, and a more gradual reduction in national 
			mortality is evident from the time these data were first available . 
			. . Whatever the reasons for the reduction in mortality, this seems 
			to be good news for patients and parents.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I am sure that we would all 
			say amen to that.  </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody">
			<span lang="EN">But that article, as the 
			Minister probably knows, is also the one that exposed a potential 
			problem at the John Radcliffe. The John Radcliffe denied that there 
			was a problem. It questioned the accuracy of the statistical methods 
			used for this paper. Although as Dr. Aylin, who stands by the 
			findings—I spoke to him only earlier today—points out— </span>

			<p class="speechbody" style="margin-left:18pt; margin-right:18pt"><i><span lang="EN">It being Ten o'clock, the

			time and I do not wish to keep people here for the sake of it.
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">As Dr. Aylin said to me, the 
			statistical methods used in the paper are the same ones that exposed 
			the problems at Bristol. It is perhaps not a coincidence that the 
			Healthcare Commission has now started looking at the John Radcliffe. 
			So in addition to the wider issue of the recommendations arising 
			from Bristol, there is the issue of the cluster that was exposed in 
			1999 at the Royal Brompton and the issue of the John Radcliffe.
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">There is also a more 
			straightforward issue, if I may call it that, and that is about 
			confidence in cardiac services. When we are dealing with individual 
			constituency cases where we are worrying on behalf of parents who 
			have suffered terribly, it is important not to forget to pay 
			sufficient tribute to what is going on. Tremendous work is going on 
			in hospitals throughout the country. There have been tremendous 
			improvements in recent years. We are only too easily led to forget 
			that doing a heart operation on a seven-week-old baby is an 
			intensely dangerous thing to do. It may be the case that it is 
			slightly less dangerous now than it was in 1983, but to describe any 
			of these operations as routine, as I saw in the press not so long 
			ago, is perhaps to miss the point. None of these is routine. A 
			newborn baby of seven weeks has a heart the size of a walnut, so the 
			work being done is of enormous importance. It is extremely complex 
			and difficult and we should be grateful to the surgeons and pioneers 
			who are doing this work. That makes it all the more important, when 
			they are doing cutting-edge work, that there is a clear record of 
			what has happened in each individual case, because we are probing at 
			the frontiers, so that we can look back in any individual case and 
			see whether what was done was appropriate. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I shall not delay the House 
			much longer, but I want to say two things to the Minister. First, I 
			have a copy of the Bell report for her. In her office yesterday I 
			perhaps naively said to Mr. Chapman of the Brompton hospital that I 
			assumed that he had furnished the Minister with a copy of the 
			report, and it turned out that he had not. I was perhaps rather 
			naive because I thought that the hospital would do everything that 
			it could to help the Minister with relevant documentation, and this 
			is nothing if not relevant, but it does not cast the hospital in a 
			particularly glowing light, so on reflection I perhaps understand 
			why it had not eagerly done that. But it is important to look at it. 
			I hope that the Minister will take it away and study it. I was 
			discussing it with Mr. and Mrs. Lynch this evening. When one reads 
			it again and again, each time new points pop out. It is a detailed 
			report of over 30 pages. I invite the Minister to appoint an 
			official to look at it closely. I know that Mr. and Mrs. Lynch would 
			be grateful for a detailed response to the conclusions of the Bell 
			report. That is the narrow point. &nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I spoke to Dr. Dominic Bell 
			earlier today and he makes a couple of points in an e-mail to me, 
			which sum up the situation quite accurately. He says that there was
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">&quot;a 
			major identifiable professional omission related to audit, the 
			evaluation of outcome from high risk surgical intervention, 
			obligatory when undertaking 'cutting edge' surgery with multiple 
			variables controlling the outcome . . . There is no evidence that 
			when the clinical features of severe neurological damage became 
			obvious, that either surgeon, anaesthetist or cardiologist 
			considered causation and reconsidered any aspect of the process of 
			care for the benefit of future cases.</span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			Once that neurological injury was identified, the clinicians had a 
			direct responsibility to ensure optimal care of the infant which 
			involved referral to the appropriate specialists and a duty to 
			inform the parents of why that was necessary. Care at this stage was 
			characterised therefore by a dereliction of both clinical and 
			professional responsibilities.</span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">The 
			lack of responsiveness, honesty and openness that has characterised 
			the hospital's approach from the initial questions of the family 
			right through to my investigation is out of kilter with public 
			expectation and arguably indicates a broader malaise of ignorance or 
			arrogance or both.</span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">A 
			duty of care extends beyond an examination, investigation, technical 
			procedure or prescribing, and should be founded in an understanding 
			of and sympathy for the plight of the parents with a profoundly ill 
			child, who need to understand the problem, prognosis and plan and 
			need to be able to trust the practitioner and the profession at this 
			very vulnerable time. Empathy and communication do not appear to 
			have featured highly on a list of responsibilities.&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">We all want to reach a 
			position in which the treatment provided by every hospital, 
			including the world famous Royal Brompton hospital, is regarded in 
			the best possible light. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I hope that the Minister takes 
			away the Bell report and studies it to consider what further steps 
			may be needed. Will she consider either holding a public inquiry or 
			asking the Healthcare Commission to expand its current review of 
			work at the John Radcliffe hospital into a more wide-ranging review 
			of paediatric cardiac services in the UK? Such a review could also 
			include adult services, because the latest Healthcare Commission 
			review concerns adult cardiac services rather than paediatric 
			cardiac services. That would allow patients to have confidence in 
			cardiac care in this country and, in particular, Mr. and Mrs. Lynch 
			to receive public and open accountability from the Royal Brompton 
			hospital for what happened to their daughter, Sarah. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN">The Minister of State, 
			Department of Health (Jane Kennedy): </span></b><span lang="EN">I 
			congratulate the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) on 
			securing this evening's debate. He should not apologise for securing 
			an Adjournment debate and is not detaining Conservative Members, who 
			are here voluntarily to support him. I am not surprised that the 
			hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) is here, because I know 
			how assiduous he is in advancing the case of his constituents—he is 
			to be respected when one deals with him across the Dispatch Box, 
			too. Before I get into the serious detail, I wish the hon. Member 
			for South Norfolk well for his wedding later this month. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I acknowledge the hon. 
			Gentleman's interest in the case and know that this particular 
			matter is of great concern to him. If he and the family will forgive 
			me, I will not respond in great detail to his careful exposition of 
			the experiences of the Lynch family, the subsequent inquiry and the 
			hospital's response. I want to express my sincere condolences to 
			Sarah's family—the death of a child is always a devastating event, 
			and I can understand Mr. and Mrs. Lynch's need to discover what 
			happened during Sarah's stay at the Royal Brompton hospital. The 
			hon. Gentleman has raised several points about the handling of 
			Sarah's case and the response by the Royal Brompton and Harefield 
			NHS Trust. However, I hope that he agrees that in line with patient 
			confidentiality, it is probably not appropriate for me to respond to 
			some of his detailed points. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">People in all sorts of 
			circumstances believe that a public inquiry is the only answer to 
			their problems. The hon. Gentleman may not know - there is no reason 
			why he should - that the Royal Liverpool children's hospital, which is 
			more commonly known as Alder Hey, is in my constituency. It is a 
			much loved and respected local institution, on which families with 
			children across the north-west of England depend. However, the 
			hospital's name was for a time synonymous with the retention of 
			organs from children, many of whom were very sick babies. There was 
			a strong call for an inquiry, which took place -&nbsp; it was a judicial 
			inquiry rather than a full-blown public inquiry. The process 
			resulted in clinicians who were not involved in the incidents that 
			gave rise to the disquiet, and who were seeking to treat, look after 
			and nurture very sick children, losing the confidence of parents at 
			that time. It has taken some years for the trust to recover its 
			position and for clinicians to feel that they have regained the 
			confidence of parents in the region. The hon. Member for Aylesbury 
			will know about public inquiries from our time in Northern Ireland, 
			and we have mixed feelings about them. . </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I will want to consider the 
			points that the hon. Member for South Norfolk has raised. If he is 
			looking for a detailed response, I will certainly give him that in 
			writing following the debate. I will perhaps give greater thought to 
			the idea of a public inquiry, which I had not considered before this 
			evening, but it is not, instinctively, a solution that I would 
			necessarily encourage. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN">Mr. Bacon: </span>
			</b>I 
			understand the Minister's reluctance. She alluded to the Saville 
			inquiry in Northern Ireland, which cost more than £200 million and 
			has apparently never settled anything. In the Bristol case, it was 
			notoriously reported that more than half the money ended up going to 
			the lawyers. There are obviously big problems with public inquiries, 
			but there should be other routes available. Perhaps there could be a 
			Hutton-style inquiry, which could take evidence, before a 
			non-clinician such as a senior judge or a Law Lord, or something via 
			the Healthcare Commission. I hope that the Minister appreciates that 
			there is a widespread nexus of issues and concerns that runs wider 
			than Mr. and Mrs. Lynch.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b>Jane Kennedy: : </b>
			<span lang="EN">I will come on to those wider concerns in a moment. 
			I am aware that, as the hon. Gentleman described, Sarah's parents 
			have been in contact with the trust over the past 20 years I hope 
			that they can find a resolution to their ongoing concerns. He is 
			absolutely right that it should be possible for that to happen, and 
			in doing so to find a degree of comfort in the process. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN">Mr. Bacon: </span></b>
			<span lang="EN">I want to say one further thing in relation to the 
			Minister's comments about patient confidentiality. I think that I 
			can speak for the parents when I say that given the events of the 
			past 20 years and the very sad death of Sarah Lynch, I do not think 
			that the parents would have an objection to the Minister speaking 
			about this publicly or writing to them with more details. They would 
			probably prefer it to be on the record. Although I appreciate that 
			the Minister is not in a position to give detailed answers now, I 
			was rather hoping, as I said to her yesterday, that the outcome of 
			this debate would not be that she sits down at 10.30 pm and we have 
			closure, but that she goes away and thinks further about these 
			issues. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN">Jane Kennedy: </span></b>
			<span lang="EN">I hope that I will be able to give some proper 
			response to the very eloquent case that the hon. Gentleman has made.
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">No one wants their child to 
			have to go into hospital. Any child having to attend hospital as a 
			patient, for any reason, is a cause for concern for all parents, 
			carers and relatives. As a parent of two sons who are now in their 
			twenties, I know only too well that it is an anxious enough time 
			when things go well. When things go wrong, there can be tragic 
			results, and patients and their families, quite rightly, want 
			answers to their questions and an apology if appropriate. Most 
			often, they tell us that they want reassurances that no one else 
			should have to undergo their experience and that all steps will be 
			taken to avoid a similar incident arising. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">There is nothing that we can 
			do to completely take away parents' concerns and anxieties, but 
			there is a lot that we can continue to do to improve the way in 
			which hospitals care for children. Let me, for five minutes or so, 
			describe what we have been doing. I am informed that the cardiac 
			surgery that Sarah received back in 1983 was the most modern of its 
			time. Without that surgery, babies, such as Sarah, born with severe 
			cardiac abnormalities might have died before they were six months of 
			age. Even now, the risks involved with major cardiac surgery on 
			small babies can be high, as the hon. Gentleman said, and parents 
			are sometimes faced with the devastating news that their baby might 
			not survive. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">A national review of NHS 
			paediatric and congenital cardiac services was published in December 
			2003. That found that all units undertaking paediatric cardiac 
			procedures were providing high standards of care for children. We 
			were reassured by the findings of that report. However, neurological 
			damage was, and continues to be, a major and often debilitating 
			complication of congenital heart disease and open-heart surgery, 
			even when the most meticulous steps are taken to avoid it. </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I hope that the hon. Gentleman 
			accepts that patient safety is at the heart of our agenda for 
			improving the quality of NHS services. Indeed, I am the first 
			Minister of State to have it as part of her ministerial title. Since 
			1997, we have been committed to building a better health service for 
			patients everywhere. I am not trying to make a political response by 
			saying that, but seeking to give the Government's position. We have 
			established new, independent standard-setting and inspecting bodies.
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Through national service 
			frameworks, national standards are in place for the first time. 
			Locally, trusts now have formal processes in place for systematic 
			review and investigation of treatments and outcomes. Those were not 
			previously in place. Indeed, I am informed that the Royal Brompton 
			hospital has for some years had a formal protocol for reporting and 
			investigating neurological injury, so that even the early clinical 
			signs of possible neurological damage are now subject to much fuller 
			investigation. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I am delighted to report today 
			that an audit of significant outcomes for 2004/05 carried out at the 
			Royal Brompton hospital states that no serious adverse events on 
			children were reported. That is out of a total of 391 congenital 
			heart operations, 66 of which were on babies up to one month old.
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>I did not think for one moment that the Minister was making a political point and I fully accept that improvements have been made over several years and that is to be greatly welcomed. Item 1 of the Bristol inquiry—the Kennedy report—is that the patient should be at the centre of everything we do. I hope that that culture is developing 
			- I stress "developing" - in the health service. </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody">However, the patient was certainly not at the centre of everything we do in Mr. and Mrs. Lynch's case. It is encouraging to hear the Minister say that a protocol is now in place to provide for a neurological inquiry in the case of a neurological insult. However, it should be obvious that when there is brain damage, neurologists should be involved. That is common sense and it is extraordinary that such a protocol was not in place in 1983. To this day, the parents have never been able to get an open account and acknowledgement of what was done and not done in the case of their child.
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b>Jane Kennedy: : </b>
			<span lang="EN">I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's points, which he 
			makes passionately, and I understand the extra grief that has been 
			caused to the family by what they perceive as the struggle that they 
			have had to get the information. I understand that the expert 
			reports from which he has quoted - not only the Bell report but the 
			others - have not been shared with the trust. If that is the case, 
			would it be possible for them to be shared with the hospital so that 
			it could consider them? </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN">Mr. Bacon: </span></b>
			<span lang="EN">They could be shared with the trust and I would be 
			happy to ensure that they were shared with Minister, too, although

			would be interested in examining them and I hope that the Minister 
			will be, too. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN">Jane Kennedy: </span></b>
			<span lang="EN">I am grateful for that. I am always surprised at how 
			rapidly time runs away with us but I wish to make some important 
			points in response to what has been said. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">As the hon. Gentleman said, 
			Sarah's case occurred more than 20 years ago. In the past eight 
			years, the NHS in England has begun to turn itself around. He knows 
			that we have increased investment and even argued vigorously about 
			how that has been done. However, it has enabled the NHS to provide 
			better quality care to patients with safer and more effective 
			treatment, better surroundings and better services. I want briefly 
			to mention one or two of those other factors because not only the 
			procedures have been improved. Protocols are now in place partly 
			through learning and understanding from the experiences of families 
			such as the Lynches. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Several well-documented 
			reports in the past few years have commented in depth on poor 
			communication with parents about to the risks associated with 
			cardiac surgery and with parents whose children regrettably suffer 
			brain damage—practice that was prevalent in the 1980s and early 
			1990s. Perhaps the most significant of those for Mr. and Mrs. Lynch 
			has been the review of Sarah's case, which the hon. Gentleman 
			described, by Dr. Dominic Bell. I have seen a copy of that and 
			although I have not had a chance to read the full report, I have 
			read the summary and the findings. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Following Dr. Bell's report in 
			2003, the trust acknowledged shortcomings in its communications with 
			the family. It also recognised that there were some failings around 
			the investigation into the power failure that occurred on the 
			evening following Sarah's operation. Paediatric cardiology services 
			have been reviewed extensively by successive inquiries. Much has 
			changed. Significant investments of time, energy and resources have 
			been committed to the paediatric service at the trust—I am not 
			speaking in general terms here; I am referring specifically to the 
			Brompton and Harefield—resulting in double the number of consultant 
			surgeons in post, establishing the cardiac liaison nursing team, 
			enhancing support for patients with neurological injury, and 
			enhancing information and support to patients, parents and carers 
			alike. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">As the hon. Gentleman rightly 
			pointed out, Sir Ian Kennedy's report into the events at Bristol 
			provided us with a powerful analysis of the organisation and culture 
			of the NHS in the years up to 1995. Responding to those concerns, we 
			fast-tracked the hospital services module of the children's national 
			service framework, which was launched in April 2003 and emphasised 
			the need to design and deliver care around the needs of children and 
			their families. We have taken on board the points that the hon. 
			Gentleman quite rightly highlighted. . </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">The way in which health 
			professionals present bad or difficult news is an important factor 
			in how it is received, understood and dealt with. That can have a 
			profound influence on the confidence and trust that a family has in 
			the health professionals concerned. The national service framework 
			recommends that staff should have training in the necessary 
			communication skills to enable them to work effectively with 
			children, young people and parents. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN" style="color: black">Mr. 
			Bacon: </span></b><span lang="EN" style="color: black">Does the 
			Minister agree that another important aspect of the communication 
			process is preparing parents in advance for what might go wrong, 
			because complicated procedures could cause problems? In the case of 
			the Lynch family, as well as many others, this has been a 
			significant problem. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN" style="color: black">Jane 
			Kennedy: </span></b><span lang="EN" style="color: black">Clearly, 
			all those factors form part of the communication needs, and the 
			professionals involved need to tread a fine line. I am sure that 
			many parents in such circumstances find such information hard to 
			take in. They are consumed with anxiety, in addition to having that 
			extra burden and possibly having to take a decision about what 
			procedures should be carried out. That is an enormous series of 
			problems to have to face. <br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			As the hon. Gentleman described, on the same day that Sarah received 
			her surgery, the hospital suffered a complete failure of the 
			electrical supply to the wing where the paediatric intensive care 
			unit was sited. He has described how the incident was apparently not 
			reported to the parents at the time. When this was discovered, it 
			obviously added to Mr. and Mrs. Lynch's concerns and, I would 
			say, distrust and distress. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman 
			will appreciate that the care and treatment that patients receive is 
			a matter for the clinical judgment of the medical team, and the 
			investigation into the subsequent outcome is for the trust to take 
			forward. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to make any 
			comment on, or to intervene in, any specific case. We need to seek 
			to get resolution at trust level if that is at all possible. </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN" style="color: black">Mr. 
			Bacon: </span></b><span lang="EN" style="color: black">I am grateful 
			to the Minister for giving way again. She has been extremely 
			generous, and I have been extremely fortunate in having this extra 
			time. Does she agree that any encouragement given to the Brompton by 
			her at the Dispatch Box to be more open in its dealings with the 
			parents, and to give an open and public account at the Brompton 
			level of what has happened, would help to get these issues resolved?
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><b><span lang="EN" style="color: black">Jane 
			Kennedy: </span></b><span lang="EN" style="color: black">I would not 
			say that only to the Brompton. One of the saddest aspects of my job 
			is reading the letters that I get from Members of Parliament 
			enclosing the experiences of their constituents who have written to 
			say how everything went wrong and that nobody explained anything. 
			All that compounds the sense of grievance. As I said earlier, most 
			people just want an explanation of what happened, along with 
			information, support and redress if they need it, and an apology if 
			it is appropriate. Most of all, people want the reassurance that the 
			institution and the professionals involved will learn from the 
			experience. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN" style="color: black">I was 
			talking about the electrical failure. After decades of 
			underinvestment in the health service, 50 per cent. of the NHS 
			estate in 1995 pre-dated the creation of the NHS in 1948. I am not 
			making a party political point here. In 1983, the paediatric 
			intensive care unit at the Royal Brompton hospital was sited in a 
			building that was 93 years old.I would seek to reassure the hon. 
			Gentleman, Mr. and Mrs. Lynch and Sarah's twin that the situation 
			today, some 22 years later, is completely different. Modern 
			technologies and generators are now more robust. Modern 
			life-critical medical equipment now remains functional under power 
			failure conditions, supported by local battery supplies. With the 
			NHS continuing to invest in buildings, equipment and infrastructure, 
			generators can now be replaced at regular intervals. A £17 billion 
			national improvement programme is updating the NHS estate, and since 
			Sarah's stay at the Royal Brompton in 1983 the paediatric intensive 
			care unit has been re-sited in the new Sydney wing. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN" style="color: black">In 
			relation to data and recording, improving paediatric intensive care 
			has been a priority for this Government. The report entitled, 
			&quot;Paediatric Intensive Care: a Framework for the Future&quot;, published 
			in 1997, recognised that clinical audit of paediatric intensive care 
			concluded that the collection of data on outcomes from intensive 
			care for children were not satisfactory. We therefore introduced a 
			dedicated audit for paediatric intensive care, which collects data from the 29 lead units. We also recognised that 
			it would take upwards of five years to achieve all the aspirations 
			in the report, and we have therefore devoted £25 million of 
			recurrent funding every year since 2000/01 for the improvement of 
			paediatric intensive care.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Sadly, 
			the improvements that I have described have come too late for Sarah, 
			her parents and her twin. I understand that representatives of the 
			Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust have extended their 
			sympathies to Mr. and Mrs. Lynch as well as an unreserved apology 
			for the tragedy that they and Sarah suffered. I hope that this 
			matter reaches a satisfactory conclusion Following the debate, I 
			will read the <i>Hansard</i> account and the Bell report in full. I 
			know that the trust would find it helpful to see the expert opinion 
			to which the hon. Gentleman referred. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN" style="color: black">I want to 
			extend again my condolences to Mr. and Mrs. Lynch. I stress, however 
			that, as I said earlier, this is a matter for the NHS to resolve. I 
			really hope that all involved are able to reach a positive outcome 
			very soon. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the opportunity 
			to discuss the matter. </span></p>
