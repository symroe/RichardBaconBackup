			<p class="speechbody"><b>
Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) 
					(Con): </b>I am grateful to have the 
					opportunity to take part in this debate. I want to focus on 
					the narrow issue of the correspondence between me and the 
					permanent secretary of the Department for Communities and 
					Local Government, to which my hon. Friend the Member for 
					Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) referred in his introduction. 
					Since that correspondence there has been an extraordinary 
					and indefensible outburst from the Secretary of State for 
					Culture, Media and Sport, the right hon. Member for Exeter 
					(Mr. Bradshaw). I should like to hear the Minister, on 
					behalf of the Government, condemn what was said and state, 
					on the record, that civil servants have done nothing wrong 
					in relation to such matters.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"></p>
					<p class="speechbody">					I wrote to the permanent secretary, Mr. Peter Housden, on 3 
					February. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I 
					see permanent secretaries from various Departments twice a 
					week, and have done so for the eight-and-a-half years that I 
					have been a member of the Committee. I am familiar with the 
					fact that one of the titles of the permanent secretary-it is 
					the reason why the permanent secretary is the witness before 
					the Public Accounts Committee-is accounting officer. 
					Permanent secretaries are legally, as opposed to 
					politically, responsible to Parliament for the effective, 
					efficient and economic use of public funds.</p>
					<p class="speechbody">					This morning, I was at a seminar, which was chaired by the 
					admirable Peter Riddell, at which a former senior Labour 
					Cabinet Minister, who has only recently stepped down from 
					the Cabinet, said, &quot;Ministers are there to represent the 
					public interest first and foremost in obtaining value for 
					money in the use of public resources. That is their job. It 
					is the job of accounting officers, of permanent secretaries, 
					to stand behind them to make sure, if there is any falling 
					short from that standard, that they notify it to the 
					appropriate authorities.&quot;</p>
					<p class="speechbody">					The right hon. Member for Exeter accused Mr. Peter Housden 
					of being biased and said that he was not surprised that the 
					documents had been leaked. May I
					say for the record that the documents were not leaked? They 
					were sent to me in response to a letter that I had written 
					to the permanent secretary. Mr. Housden copied them to the 
					Cabinet Secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnell. I can hardly think of 
					a less likely way to leak something than to send a copy of 
					what one is doing to the Cabinet Secretary. In his letter, 
					which he also attached to the Secretary of State, he said 
					that</p>
						<p class="speechquote">&#8220;I am concerned that the approach 
						you are currently proposing&#8221;-</p>

					<p class="speechbody">					that is the approach currently proposed by the Secretary of 
					State-</p>

						<p class="speechquote">&#8220;makes it difficult for me to meet 
						the standards expected of me as Accounting Officer.&#8221;</p>

					<p class="speechbody">					Far from leaking the documents, he did the right thing.</p>
					<p class="speechbody">					As for seriously mishandling the situation, I have since had 
					a letter from the Comptroller and Auditor General to whom I 
					also copied the correspondence. It is a fact of the nature 
					of requesting a direction from a Secretary of State that the 
					permanent secretary will also send copies of it to the 
					National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor 
					General. In his letter, Mr. Housden alludes to that. He 
					says:</p>
						<p class="speechquote">&#8220;As I am required to do, I will 
						send copies of your instruction and this letter, to the 
						Comptroller and Auditor General, who will normally draw 
						the matter to the attention of the Public Accounts 
						Committee.&#8221;</p>

					<p class="speechbody">					In his letter to me, which I received yesterday by e-mail, 
					the Comptroller and Auditor General said:</p>

						<p class="speechquote">&#8220;The Accounting Officer has 
						followed the correct procedure for raising his concerns 
						about the value for money of the scheme by seeking a 
						Direction from his Secretary of State and notifying me. 
						In accordance with the provisions set down in 'Managing 
						Public Money'&#8221;-</p>

					<p class="speechbody">					which is a Treasury guidance document-</p>
					
						<p class="speechquote">&quot;I have notified the Chairman of 
						the Committee of Public Accounts of this Direction.&quot;</p>
					
					<p class="speechbody">					In other words, there is no question but that the permanent 
					secretary has acted properly.</p>
					<p class="speechbody">					The reason he acted properly is that he was concerned that 
					the approach being proposed by the Government was improper, 
					an indefensible use of public funds, unfeasible in the sense 
					of being undeliverable, and almost certainly unlawful. In 
					such circumstances, he did exactly the right thing. I see 
					that Mrs. Humble has transmogrified into you, Mr. Jones, in 
					the last couple of seconds, so I will address my concluding 
					comments to you.</p>
					<p class="speechbody">					I repeat my request to the Minister to ensure that we all 
					understand, on the record, that the behaviour of that civil 
					servant has been in the finest traditions of the civil 
					service rather than against them. We all understand that the 
					career of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and 
					Sport has, in some ways, been an anger management therapy 
					and a working out of his feelings towards his former 
					employer at the BBC, but that is not a reason to lash out at 
					civil servants, and I hope that the Minister will confirm 
					that.</p>
