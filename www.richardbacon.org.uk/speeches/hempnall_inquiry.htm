		<p class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given on 1 October 2009 at the 
		Planning Inquiry into the proposal for a seven-turbine wind farm at 
		Hempnall</cite></p>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">Thank you for providing me with this opportunity to speak and for 
		your flexibility on the date and time.&nbsp; On 14 August 2008, South Norfolk 
		District Council (&#8220;SNDC&#8221;) refused planning permission for seven wind 
		turbines on land at&nbsp; Busseys Loke, Hempnall with a maximum height of 125 
		metres.&nbsp; Five reasons were given for refusal, which I do not propose to 
		restate this morning.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">The principal issue that is now in dispute between SNDC and the 
		appellant is where to strike the balance between the harm that the 
		proposed development would cause to the landscape - including the impact 
		upon visual amenity, the effect on the occupants of nearby residential 
		properties and the setting of St Margaret&#8217;s Church - compared with the 
		government&#8217;s guidance on wind turbines.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">SNDC&#8217;s own planning policy UTL 13 states that planning permission 
		will be granted for renewable energy projects provided that the benefits 
		of exploiting the renewable resource are not outweighed by demonstrable 
		harm to the locality.&nbsp; I believe that the proposal before you was 
		plainly in breach of UTL 13, as well as other local plan policies.&nbsp; 
		Policy UTL 13 is clear and balanced, neither giving local communities a 
		&#8216;get-out&#8217; clause to escape any unwanted but necessary development, nor 
		favouring energy developers in all circumstances.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">In his opening statement, counsel for the appellant Mr Hardy 
		stated that negotiations had revealed: &nbsp;&#8220;&#8230;a serious misunderstanding on 
		[SNDC&#8217;s] part regarding the way in which Central Government expects this 
		project to be treated&#8221;.&nbsp; Mr Hardy was referring to paragraph 40 of PPS 
		1, which states that developers of projects that could contribute to 
		meeting PPS 1&#8217;s Key Planning Objectives should: &#8220;expect expeditious and 
		sympathetic handling of the planning application&#8221; from the local 
		planning authority.&nbsp; However, I believe that neither PPS 22 nor 
		Paragraph 40 of PPS 1 are instructions for local planning authorities to 
		approve any and all &nbsp;renewable energy developments, irrespective of 
		their suitability.&nbsp; They merely ask that local planning authorities give 
		renewable energy projects serious consideration, that they deal with the 
		application quickly and that renewable energy developments should be 
		capable of being accommodated throughout England in locations where 
		environmental, economic, and social impacts can be addressed 
		satisfactorily. </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">It is my belief that SNDC has given this project serious and 
		sympathetic consideration and has come to the conclusion, rightly in my 
		view, that the benefits of exploiting the renewable resource are 
		outweighed by demonstrable harm to the locality and that the 
		environmental and social impacts of the proposal cannot be addressed 
		satisfactorily, bringing the proposal into conflict with key principle 
		i) of PPS 22.&nbsp; As such I believe that SNDC was correct in refusing 
		planning permission.&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
		<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;</span>Counsel for SNDC, Ms Ellis, has already eloquently made the point 
		that the government, if so minded, could have sought to take all 
		renewable energy infrastructure away from development control.&nbsp; To date, 
		it has not done so and, whilst the Planning Act 2008 seeks to determine 
		nationally important renewable energy projects at a national level, 
		onshore projects producing less than 50MW of electricity do not meet the 
		government&#8217;s test for national importance and therefore fall outside the 
		scope of the Act.&nbsp; This project would generate 14 MW of electricity at 
		best and thus fails this test.&nbsp; It means that by the government&#8217;s own 
		standards this project is not of national importance.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
				You may recall that I was unable to address the inquiry last 
		Thursday because I was taking constituents to meet the Energy Minister 
		Lord Hunt on a separate, but related, matter. &nbsp;One of the most 
		interesting points which the minister stressed at that meeting, which he 
		kindly agreed to in order to discuss with my constituents renewable 
		energy infrastructure and the impact of the Planning Act 2008, is that 
		even where the government wishes for nationally important energy 
		infrastructure projects to be decided nationally, the government is 
		still very keen to preserve a local voice.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
				In the case of Hempnall, I was left in no doubt as to what 
		precisely that local voice was saying, and the strength of feeling 
		locally about the inappropriate&nbsp;scale of this development, when I was 
		invited to a packed meeting in Hempnall Village Hall, attended by 
		residents from Hempnall and all the surrounding villages. I regret that 
		the appellant chose not to address the meeting and therefore did not 
		make the best use of the opportunities presented to it by Hempnall 
		parish council to engage with local people and to address their 
		concerns. </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
				The local District Councillor for Hempnall ward, Michael 
		Windridge, was determined to obtain an accurate assessment of local 
		opinion and he was particularly interested to encourage electors who 
		supported Enertrag's proposal to confide their views.&nbsp; Councillor 
		Windridge wrote directly to every single elector in the Parish of 
		Hempnall and, to protect respondents&#8217; confidentiality, he supplied a 
		stamped, self-addressed envelope, entirely at his own expense.&nbsp; I 
		understand that the results of that opinion survey have been included in 
		the evidence submitted to you and it is worth remembering that the 
		parish councils of Hempnall, Saxlingham, Shotesham, Tasburgh, Woodton, 
		Topcroft, Morningthorpe with Fritton, and Shelton &amp; Hardwick all voted 
		against the Enertrag proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
				It is also my understanding that Councillor Windridge has 
		subsequently written again to any new arrivals to Hempnall since March 
		2007 and that he will present those findings to you today.&nbsp; I would like 
		to take this opportunity to thank Councillor Windridge, on behalf of his 
		constituents and mine, for all his hard work in ensuring that the voices 
		of local people are heard.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
				The appellant has claimed that there is a large silent contingent 
		in the affected area who support this proposal but do not want to call 
		attention to themselves by being open about it.&nbsp; Councillor Windridge 
		has provided any covert supporters with every opportunity to give their 
		views in confidence and all I can say is that with just a few exceptions 
		they were silent then and they are still silent now.</p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
				The guiding principle for my approach to the question of wind 
		power, or indeed any development issue, is one of balance.&nbsp; We need more 
		alternative energy sources and personally I regret that the United 
		Kingdom has not taken action sooner to harness the various forms of 
		renewable energy at our disposal.&nbsp; Britain has some 11,000 miles of 
		coastline; as an island we are surrounded by some of the windiest seas 
		in the world; and North Sea Oil has provided us with more than 30 years&#8217; 
		experience in working offshore.&nbsp; All this presents Britain with very 
		significant opportunities.&nbsp; Average wind speeds offshore are higher than 
		onshore, meaning wind farms at sea will generate far more power than 
		onshore wind farms ever could, with the added advantage that they are 
		where we cannot see them.&nbsp; Micro-generation could give many homes and 
		businesses the opportunity to generate power for themselves and for the 
		National Grid, and for centuries, windmills built on a human scale have 
		blended seamlessly into the countryside.&nbsp; I accept fully that we require 
		a diverse energy mix to see us through the years ahead and to make sure 
		that Britain&#8217;s lights stay on.&nbsp; I simply do not accept what appears to 
		be the appellant&#8217;s contention, that the challenge of climate change 
		means that we are always required to accept giant on-shore industrial 
		wind turbines in sensitive rural landscapes.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
		There is a place for onshore wind power.&nbsp; SNDC has approved a 
		development of wind turbines at Hethel.&nbsp; That development placed wind 
		turbines on industrial land, which intuitively seems more appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		I have also visited the wind farm &nbsp;on the Yorkshire moors at Ovenden, 
		and it also seems that remote moor land is a more appropriate location 
		for wind turbines.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="line-height:150%; text-align:justify">
		In conclusion, SNDC&#8217;s policy, UTL 13, is clear: renewable energy 
		projects will be granted planning permission <i>provided</i> that the 
		benefits are not outweighed by demonstrable harm to the locality.&nbsp; 
		Industrial wind turbines 125 metres in height and seven times taller 
		than St Margaret&#8217;s Church in Hempnall, which is currently the tallest 
		building in the parish, would indeed inflict demonstrable harm on a very 
		significant scale.&nbsp; That is my view.&nbsp; That is SNDC&#8217;s view and, most 
		importantly of all, that is overwhelmingly the view of local residents.&nbsp; 
		The proposal before you is neither sensitive to the surroundings nor is 
		it appropriate to the proposed location.&nbsp; SNDC has in my view acted 
		correctly in refusing permission for a development that is inappropriate 
		for the area in question.&nbsp; </p>
