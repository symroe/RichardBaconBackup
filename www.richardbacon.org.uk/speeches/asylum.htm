		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in the chamber of the 
			House of Commons as part of the debate on the Asylum and Immigration Bill, on
			1 March 2004</cite></div>
		<p class="speechbody">
		<b>Mr. </b><strong>Bacon</strong><b> </b>: It is a pleasure to follow 
		the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) in 
		the debate. She referred to the fact that not a single Labour Member of 
		Parliament had spoken in support of clause 11. I think 
		that I am right in saying that not a single Member of Parliament has 
		spoken in support of the <strong style="font-weight: 400">clause</strong>. The Minister may find 
		himself in the curious position of being the only Member of Parliament 
		to speak in favour of <strong style="font-weight: 400">clause</strong> 11 on Report, which speaks 
		eloquently of its worth.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">The reason hon. 
		Members do not support <strong style="font-weight: 400">clause</strong> 11 is very simple: it is 
		a bedrock of our system that we do not have unreviewable, uncheckable 
		powers. The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) 
		put that exceptionally succinctly and clearly in his speech. The lack of 
		such power is the basis on which the Anglo-Saxon legal and political 
		tradition is built, and the Government need to understand that. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I should like to 
		raise a couple of issues with the Minister, the first of which relates 
		to the Human Rights Act 1998, which has been alluded to. I should like 
		him to make it very clear in replying to the debate whether the 
		Government assert that the Bill is now compatible with that Act. My 
		original copy of the Bill clearly stated that the Home Secretary </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;has made the following statement under 
				section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998: 
				In my view the provisions of the Asylum and Immigration 
				(Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill are compatible with the 
				Convention rights.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">If we pick a clean 
		copy of the Bill off the Table now, it says no such thing; mysteriously, 
		that certificate is no longer there. The Minister could do the House a 
		service if he clarified that point. Following the Bill's consideration 
		in Committee, do the Government say that the Human Rights Act no longer 
		applies? If they think that it applies, why is it not stated on the face 
		of the Bill? If they think that it does not apply, will they please so 
		say and attempt to justify that? </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The second point 
		that I want to make relates to the interesting, not to say amazing, 
		letter that we received from the Minister for Citizenship and 
		Immigration. In relation to <strong style="font-weight: 400">clause</strong> 11, it says that 
		section 108A is intended </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;to prevent a person 
		using judicial review to re-open an appeal by challenging removal or 
		deportation following an unsuccessful appeal. However </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">unfortunately</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">as drafted paragraph . . . could be 
				interpreted as affecting an individual's right to challenge the 
				lawfulness of their detention and the right to compensation 
				following their unlawful detention as a result of action by IND 
				or the Tribunal. This would place the UK in breach of . . . 
				article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights . . . The 
				Government's position has always been that the measures being 
				introduced by section 108A will not exclude judicial review&quot;,
				</p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">thus, the new 
		Government amendment. It continues by saying that the amendments </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;will ensure that the restriction on 
				access to the higher courts cannot be interpreted as extending 
				to challenges to actions of IND, or actions of the Tribunal in 
		breach of article 5&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">which will therefore </p>
	
				<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;place beyond doubt that the provisions 
				contained in section 108A do not prevent a person from 
				challenging an executive decision in the higher courts.&quot; </p>
		
		
		<p class="speechbody">If all that is 
		clear, one wonders what all the fuss was about. But unfortunately, when 
		one reads the Bill and examines the powers of the president, all remains 
		unclear. Subsection (4) of proposed new section 108B states: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;The President may refer a point of law 
				only if the proceedings in the course of which the point arises 
				. . . have not been determined by the Tribunal&quot;. </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Of course, it is 
		entirely possible for someone who is affected by a decision to say 
		during a tribunal hearing that the case before the tribunal was affected 
		by a lack of jurisdiction or an irregularity, or by an error of law or a 
		breach of natural justice. According to 
		<strong style="font-weight: 400">clause</strong> 11 as 
		drafted, however, if the president of the tribunal says, &quot;Well, 
		actually, the case is not affected by lack of jurisdiction, 
		irregularity, error of law or a breach of natural justice&quot;, he is then 
		barred from referring the case to a higher court, unless - a propos the 
		provision referred to by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for 
		Harborough (Mr. Garnier) - the tribunal decides that it will review the 
		decision on appeal, which it can do if it is satisfied that the decision 
		would have been different but for a clear error of law. The president 
		could be confronted with the possibility that there was a clear error of 
		law and say, &quot;No, there wasn't&quot;. But the Bill states elsewhere that he 
		is barred from making a referral, so the two different parts of the Bill 
		are contradictory. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The third issue that 
		I want to raise has already been referred to, so I shall not dwell on 
		it. Fundamentally, the problem is not a legal one but an administrative 
		one, which is why I support amendment No. 93 and new 
		<strong style="font-weight: 400">clause</strong> 
		8, the purposes of which are to speed up administration of the appeals 
		system. The answer to the problem is not to drive a coach and horses 
		through the whole legal apparatus, or to undermine the bedrock on which 
		our liberties have stood - which is that we do not have un-reviewable or 
		un-checkable power - but to speed up the administrative processes. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">As the hon. Member 
		for Cannock Chase (Tony Wright) said - he is no longer in his place - the 
		House of Lords will not look kindly on the Bill; and, as the hon. Member 
		for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) said, the fact that 
		not a single Member has so far spoken in favour of 
		<strong style="font-weight: 400">clause</strong> 
		11 will give the Lords courage in resisting it and seeking to amend it. 
		Although the hon. Member for Cannock Chase was right to say that the 
		other place will not look kindly on <strong style="font-weight: 400">clause</strong> 11 and 
		probably seek heavily to review it, the judges themselves will not look 
		kindly on it either. The history of the Executive's attempts to impose 
		ouster <strong style="font-weight: 400">clauses</strong> in this way suggests that if the judges 
		see that an injustice will be done in a particular case unless they 
		intervene, they will find a way to do so. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Ultimately, the 
		Government will succeed simply in undermining the rationality and logic 
		of the rule of law, because they will force the judiciary to become ever
		more creative and imaginative in finding a way 
		round it. That cannot be in anybody's interests. In fact, the Law 
		Commission has an obligation to simplify and clarify the law, which is 
		what we should all seek to do, so that everyone can understand it. The 
		solution to this problem is an administrative one. The Government should 
		not seek to solve it by declaring war on the judiciary.<br>
