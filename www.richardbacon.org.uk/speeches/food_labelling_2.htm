<h3>Better country-of-origin food labelling for 
  British consumers</h3>
<hr size="1" id="line">
		<p class="asublist" style="text-align: justify"><cite>On 29 October 2008, I introduced a Bill into the House of Commons to change the law on food labelling. The aim is to give consumers more information about where the food they buy comes from.</cite>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top"> <span style="color:black">Mr Speaker, I beg to move, </span></p>
        <p class="speechquote" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top">That leave be given to bring in a Bill 
          to make further provision for relevant information about food, 
          including information about the country of origin, contents and 
          standards of production of that food, to be made available to 
          consumers by labelling, marking or in other ways; and for connected 
          purposes.</p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top"> <span style="color:black">Mr Speaker, the first occasion on which I 
          sought the leave of the House to introduce a Bill to require clearer 
          labelling of food was in 2004.&nbsp; I was certainly not the first member 
          to seek to introduce such legislation, and many honourable members 
          across the House have supported the proposition that consumers 
          should have clearer, more accurate and more honest information about 
          the food they buy than is currently required. </span></p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top"> <span style="color:black">Since 2004, the interest in local sourcing 
          of food and local production has grown significantly. The issue of 
          &#8216;food miles&#8217; has become more prominent in political discussion. And 
          the importance for consumers of higher animal welfare standards has 
          continued to increase. Only this morning on the BBC Radio 4 
          programme Farming Today, an egg farmer spoke of his continued shift 
          towards free range hens for egg production, because this was what 
          consumers wanted.</span></p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top"> <span style="color:black">Attempts to improve the law continue and, 
          in addition to my own Bill, which has support from Members on all 
          sides of the House, I notice that the honourable member for 
          Warrington South will be seeking leave to bring in her own Food 
          Labelling Bill next week, which I understand focuses mainly on 
          nutrition and health issues. This complements my own Bill which, in 
          addition to providing information about the contents and production 
          standards of food, ensures that information about the country of 
          origin of different foods would be included on labelling.</span></p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top"> <span style="color:black">Consumers should have the information they 
          need to make informed decisions about the food they buy. There is a 
          wide range of issues which may quite rightly be of concern to them 
          in making their purchasing decisions. These include the nutritional 
          and calorific value of food, the salt or fat content, the animal 
          welfare standards under which food is produced, and the country of 
          origin.</span></p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top"> <span style="color:black">Any food labelling regime must seek to 
          address these various concerns.&nbsp; It is important that all food 
          producers adhere to the same high standards for food labelling and 
          the best way to achieve this is through a statutory framework.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align:justify"> <span style="color:black">The Food Labelling Regulations 1996 
          require food to be marked or labelled with certain requirements such 
          as the name of the food, a list of ingredients, the amount of an 
          ingredient which is named or associated with the food, an 
          appropriate durability indication, any special storage conditions, 
          the name of business and manufacturer and in certain cases, the 
          place of origin, as well as the process used in manufacture and 
          instructions for use. </span></p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top"> <span style="color:black">In July this year the Food Standards 
          Agency has recently updated its guidance on </span>the use of 
          marketing terms such as 'fresh', 'pure' and 'natural' but there was 
          nothing new on country of origin labelling, although the <span style="color:black">guidance continues to draw attention to 
            Regulation 5 of the 1996 Food Labelling Regulations which requires:</span></p>
        <p class="speechquote">&#8220;&#8230;particulars 
          of the place of origin or provenance of the food if failure to give 
          such particulars might mislead a purchaser to a material degree as 
          to the true origin or provenance of the food&#8230;&#8221;</p>
        <p class="speechbody"><span style="font-style:normal">Currently, 
          country of origin labelling must comply with the Food Safety Act 
          1990 and with the Trade Descriptions Act 1968.&nbsp; These make it an 
          offence to label any food in a way that falsely describes it or 
          which is likely to mislead as to its nature, substance or quality. 
          However, neither Act <span style="layout-grid-mode:line">defines how 
            much British involvement is required before produce can be sold as 
            British.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none"> The specific expression &#8220;country of origin&#8221; is not defined in the 
          Food Labelling Regulations 1996 or in the Food Labelling Directive 
          2000/13/EC.&nbsp; However, the approach taken in Section 36 of the Trade 
          Descriptions Act 1968 is that, for the purposes of that Act, goods 
          are deemed to have been manufactured or produced in the country 
          where they last underwent a treatment or process resulting in a 
          substantial change. This is likely to include the manufacture of 
          bacon or ham, for example.</p>
        <p class="speechbody"><span style="color:black;font-style:normal"> However, at present, consumers are being misled. Pork that has been 
          imported from Denmark and then packaged in the UK may be called 
          &#8220;Product of Britain&#8221;.&nbsp; The problem can apply to other food products 
          too.&nbsp; Butter churned in England using milk imported from Belgium 
          should not, supposedly, be labelled &#8220;English&#8221;, but it can lawfully 
          be described as &#8220;produced in England from milk&#8221;.&nbsp; Norwegian salmon 
          that has been smoked in Scotland should not, supposedly, be called 
          &#8220;Scottish&#8221; but it can lawfully be described as &#8220;salmon smoked in 
          Scotland&#8221;.&nbsp; </span> <span style="layout-grid-mode:line;font-style:normal">Slaughtering 
            in this country would count, so that &#8220;British lamb&#8221; could mean 
            imported lambs slaughtered and packaged in the UK. </span></p>
        <p class="speechbody"><span style="font-style:normal">Products can 
          be labelled as &#8220;produced in the UK&#8221; when all the ingredients come 
          from outside the country. There is concern that some companies have 
          taken advantage of these slack regulations and label their products 
          with the Union Jack, accompanied by slogans such as &#8220;traditional 
          British food&#8221;<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">&nbsp; or&nbsp; &#8220;great 
            British recipe&#8221; when in fact they are not produced in this country. </span></span></p>
        <p class="speechbody">There is obviously a duty on consumers to read 
          the labels in the first place but there is also a need to prevent 
          labels, presentation and other information being misleading about 
          the product. Country of origin is an element with a particular 
          potential for consumers to be misled.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">Clear mandatory country of origin labelling 
          would significantly reduce the risk that consumers making a food 
          purchasing decision should be misled or in practice be unable to use 
          their consumer power to support domestic producers, if that is what 
          they wish to do.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="speechbody">Country of origin labelling already exists for 
          beef and I believe it should be extended to cover other fresh meat. 
          There are more complex issues in the labelling of processed meat and 
          dairy products, where the sourcing frequently varies. I acknowledge 
          that these issues would need to be considered carefully in 
          Committee.&nbsp; Modern labelling technology has improved considerably in 
          recent years and I am persuaded that it would be easier for 
          processed food manufacturers to comply with country of origin 
          labelling requirements than in the past, but I acknowledge that 
          processed food does present greater difficulties for labelling than 
          fresh meat.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">This morning I was pleased to attend the David 
          Black Memorial Award Breakfast in the House of Lords, celebrating 
          the achievements of the British pig industry despite very difficult 
          conditions in recent years and, particularly, to honour the 
          contribution to the industry of this year&#8217;s award winner, Ian 
          Campbell MBE.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">I was also pleased to receive a copy of this 
          film, <i>An Inconvenient Trough</i>, made by a group of pig farmers 
          and launched this morning. This is an excellent follow-up to the 
          campaign &#8220;Stand by Your Ham&#8221;, which last summer featured Winnie the 
          Pig in a stall opposite Downing Street, where she drew thousands of 
          visitors, including many honourable members. </p>
        <p class="speechbody">This film draws attention to the conditions 
          facing pig farmers, notably that 70 per cent of the imports of pork 
          and pork products into the United Kingdom are produced to animal 
          welfare standards that would unlawful in this country.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">It is in this context that we must look at 
          country of origin labelling. I must emphasise that this is not in 
          order to prevent consumers from buying products from where they 
          wish, but rather to ensure that they are making informed decisions 
          and that they cannot be misled.</p>
        <p class="speechbody">Government can also do more. The pig industry 
          has produced its own Quality Standard Mark for Pork, and for other 
          pork products such as bacon and ham. This Mark shows that the meat 
          has been produced to higher animal welfare standards. Yet 76 per 
          cent of bacon served in Whitehall departments and 39 per cent of 
          pork served in Whitehall departments is only produced to the lower 
          EU standards, not to the higher standard of the Quality Standard 
          Mark.</p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top"> <span style="color:black">I make no secret of the fact that I wish 
          all consumers would buy British meat all the time. But achieving 
          this is a matter for consumers and it is not the purpose of my 
          Bill.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: top"> <span style="color:black">I would just like to see a fair deal for 
          British farmers and to ensure they are given the chance to compete 
          fairly with overseas products; that the lower animal welfare 
          standards often applied to imported production are clearly marked 
          for consumers&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as the higher standards of domestic 
          production; and that farmers are able to engage the consumer in 
          supporting the high standards of food safety, animal welfare and 
          environmental care that lie at the heart of British farming and 
          cannot be undermined by misleading labelling of competing products. 
          A vital part of facilitating this shift in priorities would be to 
          ensure that this country has far more rigorous and transparent food 
          labelling. I commend this Bill to the House.</span></p>
