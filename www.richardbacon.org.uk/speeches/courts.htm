		<div class="asublist"><i>Given in the Standing Committee on the Asylum and Immigration Bill on 20 January 2004</i></div>
		&nbsp;<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="color: black; font-weight:700">Mr. Bacon:</span><span style="color:black"> 
			I listened with awe to my hon. and learned Friend's speech, as many 
			people will have done. I think that it adds substance to the claim 
			that something novel and important is being done. The phrase 
			''constitutional outrage'' has been used. He mentioned the Soviet 
			Union and the People's Republic of China, and my hon. Friend the 
			Member for Woking mentioned Mugabe, to jeers from one or two members 
			of the Committee. However, this is a matter of huge seriousness. 
			Clause 10 is the most important part of the Bill. In particular, I 
			want to address the issues raised in amendments Nos. 43, 44, 45 and 
			66. 
			<p class="speechbody"\>Such measures appear not only under 
			this Government. I fear that it is what Governments do, not only a 
			Government of such a complexion. In fact, one would least expect it 
			from Governments of this complexion. I think that it is evidence 
			that one should always be fairly distrustful of any Government. The 
			checks and balances that provide protections to citizens are at the 
			core of our system. They are constitutional fundamentals, which we 
			tamper with at our peril.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"\>In the national cathedral in
			Washington DC, around the pulpit and supporting it, is a depiction in stone of the barons at 
			Runnymede handing the magna carta to King John. I remember being 
			very surprised and interested to see that, in the very pulpit of one 
			of the most important religious buildings in the United States, lies 
			a tribute not to the glories of those who have power but to the 
			limits placed upon them. If one walks into this building through the 
			public entrance and comes through St. Stephen's Hall, one sees on 
			the right a painting of Sir Thomas More and Cardinal Wolsey, with 
			other Members of the House of Commons. The caption reads: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">''Sir Thomas More, as 
			Speaker of the Commons, in spite of Cardinal Wolsey's imperious 
			demand, refuses to grant King Henry VIII a subsidy without due 
			debate.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">The notion that we do 
			not have unchecked power - that we do not have arbitrary power, and 
			that no power exists that cannot be reviewed - is absolutely at the 
			heart of our system. There are people who have said that that is one 
			of the great contributions of the Anglo-Saxon system to world 
			civilisation. I think that<span style="color:black"> it was Kahlil Gibran, 
			the Arab philosopher, who said that the contribution of the English 
			is analysis and self-righteousness. As there are Scottish members of 
			the Committee, I shall not dwell on that point. However, it is true 
			that the contribution of the Anglo-Saxon legal and political system, 
			above all else, has been to stress the importance of limited 
			government, that the Government should be constrained and restrained 
			by those whom they are governing. That is at the heart of our 
			system, and what our courts have always tried to reflect. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span style="color:black">The Minister referred to the point 
			about finality in the Bill. It is true that many statutes provide 
			that some decisions should be final, which would at least appear to 
			bar an appeal. However, the courts have always refused to allow such 
			provisions to hamper the operation of judicial review. He quoted two 
			famous textbooks, by Dicey and Wade, in support of his case. I 
			referred to Wade earlier to show that I thought the Minister was 
			perhaps incorrect. In fact, Wade firmly refutes the suggestion that 
			the provisions of judicial review shall be seriously hampered. I 
			have here my old tatty copy of Wade and it says on the back:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''Judges and counsel frequently cite this work in courts of law.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I hope that if it is 
			suitable for a court of law, it is also suitable for this high court 
			of Parliament.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">On page 720, Wade says that</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">
			''there is a firm 
			judicial policy against allowing the rule of law to be undermined by 
			weakening the powers of the court. Statutory restrictions on 
			judicial remedies are given the narrowest possible construction, 
			sometimes even against the plain meaning of words.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">It is true that there 
			have been spats between Parliament and the courts over many 
			centuries over the question of the extent to which Parliament can 
			introduce ouster clauses. Indeed, in some cases, when the courts 
			started to operate administrative law in its modern form in the 17th 
			century, they went too far. Parliament retaliated by introducing no 
			certiorari clauses. I shall not try the Committee's patience by 
			naming all the cases, but the germane point was made by my hon. 
			Friend the Member for Woking - I point to him, but he seems to have 
			transmogrified into my hon. and learned Friend the Member for 
			Harborough. He quoted Lord Denning, who wrote about no certiorari 
			clauses. Parliament had, to some extent, been right to retaliate in 
			order to order to stop the abuses. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span style="color:black">I quote Lord Denning in full: </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">''In stopping this abuse, 
			the statutes proved very beneficial, but the court never allowed 
			those statutes to be used as a cover for wrongdoing by tribunals. If 
			tribunals were to be at liberty to exceed their jurisdiction without 
			any check by the courts, the rule of law would be at an end.''
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Wade continues:
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">
			''This epitomises the court's determination to preserve regularity in the legal system, 
			and to construe every Act of Parliament as intended to uphold it.''
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody">That is to say, to 
			uphold the legal system. Earlier, the Minister mentioned my 
			reference to the case of Anisminic. Anisminic 
			Ltd. v. the Foreign Compensation Commission is still the leading 
			case. Wade refers to it as the high water mark of judicial review. 
			The crucial words in that case were the provision of the Foreign 
			Compensation Act 1950, that the determination of the commission
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">''shall not be called in 
			question in any court of law.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Yet determinations of 
			the commission were called into question by courts of law for five 
			years. In the end the House of Lords granted a declaration that it 
			was ultra vires and a nullity. Wade comments that that shows clearly 
			the great determination of the courts to uphold their longstanding 
			policy of resisting attempts by Parliament to disarm them by 
			enacting provisions that, if interpreted literally, would confer 
			uncontrollable power on subordinate tribunals. The philosopher Karl 
			Popper said that the one thing that we have to fear is arbitrary, 
			unchecked power. The Bill goes in completely the wrong direction in 
			that respect.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span style="color:black">My fear, as I looked through my old, 
			tatty copy of Wade, was that perhaps I had completely missed the 
			point. When the Minister said that Wade supported him, I thought 
			that either I had completely misread the Bill or Wade had been 
			completely rewritten. I was loath to take my coloured highlighters 
			and draw all over the latest edition - and I am sure that the House of 
			Commons Librarian would have been loath to allow me to - but I took the 
			trouble to check it, to ensure that the position had not been 
			completely reversed, as it seemed odd to me that the Minister said 
			that Wade supported him. Having done a careful analysis of my 
			edition and the latest edition, I can report that the Minister is 
			right in one respect. I quote from page 709: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">''Parliament has not, 
			however, abandoned its attempts to devise a really judge-proof 
			formula.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">That is the extent to 
			which he is right about Wade, and no further.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span style="color:black"> 
						My hon. Friend the 
			Member for Woking mentioned Lord Denning. It is interesting to look 
			at the front of the eighth edition of Wade, where it says 
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">''This edition is 
			dedicated to the memory of Lord Denning who died in 1999 aged 100. A 
			great judge, an architect of administrative law and a friend of this 
			book.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">That makes the point 
			fairly conclusively. I did not want to rely on one textbook, even if 
			the Minister had claimed that it supported him, so I studied with 
			great interest the briefing from Matrix Chambers. When I came into 
			Parliament, I did not think that it was going to be my place to 
			speak up for right-on lawyers, but having read through this 
			first-class briefing, I think that perhaps I should have become one; 
			I might have prospered. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking 
			referred to the fact that the name of the Prime Minister's wife is 
			absent from the list of distinguished barristers and silks. That is 
			strange, but there it is. It is a good briefing 
			and it makes a number of important points, one of which is that this 
			does not apply only to asylum; it is much wider-ranging.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">The briefing says 
			that the clause:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''provides a precedent for exempting the executive and administrative tribunals from 
			seeking to understand, apply or be governed by the law.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">It goes on to say 
			that, in the view of the distinguished barristers, it is a 
			matter of great constitutional significance, particularly at a time 
			of so much constitutional turmoil. The traditional institutions that 
			have served to provide some measure of check are being undermined 
			without any clear understanding of what is going to take their 
			place. 
			 
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody">Page 2 of the briefing describes the Bill as follows:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">''In effect what has been 
			billed as a measure to speed up immigration decision making is a 
			barely disguised attack on the function and jurisdiction of the 
			judiciary at a time when that function and jurisdiction is needed as 
			never before''.</p>
			<p class="speechbody">and over the page:
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''Whatever the 
			substantive law is there needs to be access to a court to ensure 
			that it is being complied with.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">There needs to be 
			access to a court to ensure that it is being complied with. Either 
			we believe that the courts should uphold Acts of Parliament and the 
			rule of law, or we do not. But if they are to uphold the rule of law 
			it is essential that whatever the law is, people should have access 
			to the courts in order to uphold it. The Matrix brief continues:
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''It is this principle'' -
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody">the principle of access to the court to ensure 
			that the law is being complied with -</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''that is threatened by 
			the ouster clause.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">My hon. Friend referred to the list of 
			extraordinary events - the lack of 
			jurisdiction, irregularity, error of law, breach of natural justice 
			and so on - that the Bill would oust. Notwithstanding those matters, 
			there would be no power of the court to look at the case to review 
			the decision. </p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span style="color:black">There is a very good 
			brief from the Refugee Council, Amnesty International and the 
			Refugee Legal Centre and I strongly support its conclusion: </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''The attempt to prevent 
			judicial oversight is of major constitutional significance and seeks 
			to put the decision-making process beyond the law.'</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I cannot easily add 
			to that, save to say that if members of the Committee were to think 
			that only what I would describe as right-on lawyers come to that 
			conclusion, I refer them to the opinion of the Law Society, a sober 
			group of people, who came to the conclusion that the Bill would mean 
			that</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''if a tribunal, in 
			determining an application, made an error of law or failed to give 
			proper consideration to relevant facts, the only redress would be to 
			ask the tribunal to review its decision. This review would only be 
			through written submissions. No matter how erroneous the decision, 
			the applicant would have no means of challenging the tribunal's 
			ruling.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I have sat in on 
			tribunals, although not immigration tribunals, covering issues such 
			as the disability living allowance, and on behalf of some of my 
			constituents I am extremely glad that the ability to review 
			tribunals' decisions exists. Despite what some hon. Members think, I have no 
			doubt that while many tribunal presidents and chairman are not 
			judges, their decisions are capable of being seriously wrong. They 
			are capable of ignoring basic facts and the rules of natural justice 
			and it is right that those bodies should be reviewable. The Law 
			Society concludes: </p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''Clause 10 goes far 
			beyond what is reasonable. The ability of the judiciary to oversee 
			the actions of administrative tribunals is fundamental to the rule 
			of law. This proposal to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court is 
			unprecedented. Bearing in mind that decisions on claims for asylum 
			can literally be life or death matters. . .''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">I refer the Committee 
			to the earlier speech of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for 
			Harborough. It is especially reprehensible that the Government 
			should seek to eliminate proper judicial scrutiny of decisions in 
			these cases.</p>
			<P class="speechbody">I referred to the opinion of Mr. Iain Miller, the litigation partner at Wright Son and 
			Pepper, a firm of lawyers in Gray's Inn. I say, for the benefit of 
			the Committee and to avoid any appearance of not declaring my 
			interest, that Mr. Miller used to be a flatmate of mine, although in 
			the present climate - 
			<P class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Garnier: </b>He is not the Lord Chancellor, then.

			<P class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon: </b>Not yet. Bearing in mind the Minister's boss, quoting a flatmate can only add to the weight of one's views.
 
			<p class="speechbody">Mr. Miller's opinion 
			is this:
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''I am sure that the 
			Administrative Court judges are keen to get rid of unmeritorious 
			immigration cases. Surely the sensible course is to have a special 
			fast track admin court procedure on say immigration points of law 
			where permission can be dealt with in a couple of days.''
				</p>
			<p class="speechbody">It has been suggested 
			that the answer is to reform the procedures, not completely to 
			undermine the rule of law. In the absence of such reform, Mr. Miller 
			adds that his instinct is that the current draft, which he describes 
			as a declaration of war with the judiciary, will not stand and:</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left: 20pt">
			''if there is a case 
			where there is a clear injustice they will get around it as they did 
			in Anisminic.''</p>
			<p class="speechbody">My own view is that 
			that is correct. In the end this action by the Government will not 
			succeed, never mind what the other place may make of the provisions 
			in the Bill. I fear that it will force judges to become ever more 
			imaginative. It will undermine the rule of law. It will undermine 
			the logic and the rationality of the law. Ultimately, it will fail. 
			The Minister should note that the book to which he referred is 
			called ''Administrative Law''. Surely the answer is to sort out the 
			administration, not to drive a coach and horses through the law.<br>
