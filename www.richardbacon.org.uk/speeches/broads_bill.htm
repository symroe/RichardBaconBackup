		on 7 May 2008 in the debate on the Third Reading of the Broads Authority 
		Bill.</cite></p>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<div class="recordsBody">
			<div id="maincontent1">
				<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) 
				(Con):</b> The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) has 
				covered these matters in exhaustive, not to say exhausting, 
				detail, so I shall try to be brief. I placed a blocking motion 
				on the Order Paper because, like him, I thought that these 
				issues should be aired. Matters that are important to our 
				constituents should not simply go through the House on the nod.</p>
				<p class="speechbody">I feel at best lukewarm about the Bill, 
				partly because of the local government review, which has been 
				mentioned. If restructuring is being considered, which it is&#8212;I 
				hope that that does not happen, and I do not believe that it is 
				inevitable&#8212;there is a strong argument that we should just wait 
				to see what happens and incorporate the Bill into that. The 
				authority&#8217;s composition is obviously going to change at some 
				point, and Parliament will need to return to this issue either 
				through that local government legislation or through other 
				means, such as a specific piece of extra legislation, so there 
				is an argument for waiting until then.</p>
				<p class="speechbody">The Committee has done good and thorough 
				work on the Bill, and I congratulate the hon. Member for 
				North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) on that. I also 
				congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on 
				promoting the Bill as he has done. I shall not oppose its Third 
				Reading, and I think that the House should allow it to proceed. 
				However, it is important that we allow the views of those who 
				oppose it to be aired and placed on the record, not least so 
				that if those views, however alarmist or lurid they might seem, 
				should later prove to have been justified, there will be 
				something to refer back to. If necessary, we could revisit the 
				issue with new legislation.</p>
				<p class="speechbody">It is worth stressing the point about 
				national parks, because several hon. Members have talked about 
				national parks as though the broads area were one, but it is 
				not&#8212;as the hon. Member for North Norfolk correctly pointed out. 
				There is a reason for that, which is clear from looking at the 
				National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and Lord 
				Sandford&#8217;s review of national parks in the early 1970s. National 
				parks have two basic purposes: conservation of the natural 
				environment and providing the public with access to those areas. 
				If there is a conflict between those aims&#8212;or, I should say, if 
				it is not possible by skilful management to reconcile 
				them&#8212;conservation should come first. However, the Norfolk and 
				Suffolk Broads Act 1988 makes it clear that there are three 
				purposes for the authority:</p>
				<ul>
					<p class="speechquote">&#8220;conserving and enhancing the natural 
					beauty of the Broads...promoting the enjoyment of the Broads 
					by the public...and protecting the interests of navigation.&#8221;</p>
				</ul>
				<p class="speechbody">So, from the Act&#8217;s inception, it has 
				always been agreed that protecting the interests of navigation 
				was an explicit statutory principle that, because of the 
				Sandford principles, excluded the possibility of the Broads 
				Authority being a national park.</p>
				<p class="speechbody">The central fear underlying the concerns 
				that have been expressed to us and to the Committee by 
				petitioners, is that, as a result of the Bill, navigation could 
				be compromised and could end up taking a back seat to 
				conservation and wildlife, when in fact the ever-present need to 
				balance all these factors is precisely why the broads are not a 
				national park.</p>
				<p class="speechbody"><b>Dr. Gibson:</b> What is the hon. 
				Gentleman&#8217;s view of the strength of the navigation committee to 
				advise and to promote ideas about navigation to the Broads 
				Authority?</p>
				<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Bacon:</b> The navigation committee 
				has an extremely important role to play, and I fear that the 
				Broads Authority has not exactly covered itself in glory by the 
				way in which it has proposed changes to the committee&#8217;s 
				membership. In fact, it is fair to say that the Broads Authority 
				was a little careless, to put it kindly, to have acted in such a 
				way that it now finds that many navigators do not trust it. I 
				know that the authority has gone some way towards allaying the 
				navigators&#8217; concerns. The hon. Member for North Norfolk 
				mentioned the Royal Yachting Association, the British Marine 
				Federation and the Inland Waterways Association.</p>
				<p class="speechbody">However, the hon. Gentleman did not 
				mention the Norfolk and Suffolk Boating Association or the 
				Norfolk Broads Yacht Club&#8212;and for good reason. Although 
				discussions took place with the Norfolk and Suffolk Boating 
				Association, it has expressed certain fears since the Committee 
				chaired by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire met. I 
				should like to quote one of the petitioners, Mr. Philip Ollier, 
				the executive secretary of the Norfolk and Suffolk Boating 
				Association. In an e-mail this year, he wrote:</p>
				<ul>
					<p class="speechquote">&#8220;In September 2007, the Broads 
					Authority Chief Executive brought forward proposals to alter 
					the way appointments are made to the Navigation Committee&#8221;.</p>
				</ul>
				<p class="speechbody">It is worth noting that that was written 
				in September, after the Committee of the House had considered 
				the Bill. Mr. Ollier goes on to say:</p>
				<ul>
					<p class="speechquote">&#8220;Previously eight places on the 
					committee were allocated to persons nominated by bodies 
					representing the various navigation interests.&#8221;</p>
				</ul>
				<p class="speechbody">The charge made is that</p>
				<ul>
					<p class="speechquote">&#8220;The process will be open to 
					manipulation by the BA Executive and follows similar changes 
					that have been implemented to reduce the representation of 
					navigation interests on the Broads Authority itself. Given 
					the changes to the composition of the Navigation Committee, 
					the assurances obtained in the negotiations about the Bill 
					start to look less reliable.&#8221;</p>
				</ul>
				<p class="speechbody">A constituent of mine, Mr. Graham Trimmer 
				from Poringland, has expressed his fears in even more colourful 
				terms. Referring to the issue of public safety, he said:</p>
				<ul>
					<p class="speechquote">&#8220;the Chairman of the Broads Authority 
					appears to suggest...that the Bill is only about public 
					safety. This is a smokescreen, since adequate byelaws were 
					enacted and came into force in April last year, allowing for 
					the enforcement of a comprehensive boat safety scheme.&#8221;</p>
				</ul>
				<p class="speechbody">I have spoken to some of the people in my 
				constituency who own boats, and some of them have told me that 
				they would not be able to get a licence from the Broads 
				Authority had they not already been through the process of 
				getting a boat safety certificate.</p>
				<p class="speechbody">These are examples of people&#8217;s concerns 
				about the Bill. I fear that the way in which the authority has 
				conducted itself&#8212;even to the extent of supposedly entering into 
				legal agreements with the concerned bodies&#8212;has, in the words of 
				the Committee, created a legal ambiguity, and perhaps created 
				more problems than it has solved. When I first heard about the 
				legal agreements that were being entered into, I wondered how it 
				was possible to enter into such an agreement with a third party 
				in relation to a Bill that had not yet been passed. I wondered 
				what possible effect those agreements could have in law, in 
				terms of the subsequent powers of the authority, given that the 
				Bill had not yet been passed. Indeed, the Committee appears to 
				agree about that. Paragraph 9 of its report to the House states:</p>
				<ul>
					<p class="speechquote">&#8220;It is our view that such agreements 
					would not have any legal effect as they could not be seen to 
					fetter the discretion given to the Authority in the 
					legislation once the Bill was enacted.&#8221;</p>
				</ul>
				<p class="speechbody">I will not dwell on the issue of direct 
				elections, as it has already been referred to, save to comment 
				that it is a sensible principle to explore. Where an authority 
				has planning powers, as this one does, it seems quite wrong that 
				there should be no directly elected input if a way can be found 
				to achieve that.</p>
				<p class="speechbody">I fear that the authority&#8217;s approach has 
				not enabled the House to give it the warm cross-party 
				endorsement that it might otherwise have had, and serious 
				concerns among our constituents remain. That said, there will be 
				further opportunities in the other place. As the hon. Member for 
				North Norfolk said, the ultimate test will be the behaviour of 
				the authority in interpreting and using its powers in the years 
				ahead. If the fears of the navigators prove justified, we will 
				know soon enough, and we will have the opportunity to do 
				something about it in due course.</p>
