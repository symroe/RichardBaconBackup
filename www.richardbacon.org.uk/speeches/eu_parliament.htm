			House of Commons on
			10 December 2002</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South 
		Norfolk):</b> I am pleased to have an opportunity of speaking in 
		the debate. I want to raise three specific issues. The first is about 
		human rights, especially in relation to other overseas territories. The 
		hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle), who is not in his place, raised 
		that point. Secondly, I want to consider the Electoral Commission and 
		the role of the Lord Chancellor. My third point is about the operation 
		of the combined region and proportional representation. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We are discussing the 
		matter today because of the European Court of Human Rights and its 
		judgment. The Parliamentary Secretary said that the Matthews judgment 
		did not apply to the Channel Islands. However, the Bill and the other 
		documentation suggests that the point about the Matthews case is nothing 
		to do with the wishes of the Gibraltarian Government or those of any 
		other Government of a British overseas territory. Two questions are 
		relevant. Had the British permanent representative to the Council of 
		Europe, who makes a declaration about the European convention on human 
		rights, declared specific territories to be within the ambit of 
		convention? Did any of those territories have the right of individual 
		petition before the European Court? So long as both of those conditions 
		are satisfied, and despite the stance, whatever it might be, of the 
		Government of the Channel Islands—the Bailiwicks of Guernsey or Jersey, 
		for example—it might be open to a citizen to petition the European 
		Court, just as it was open to Denise Matthews to do so. Presumably, in 
		the same circumstances, if the convention were applicable and there were 
		a right of individual petition before the European Court, the Court 
		would reach the same decision again. I would be grateful if the Minister 
		would expand on that, because she did not go into the matter in detail 
		earlier. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">My next point relates 
		to the Electoral Commission and the powers of the Lord Chancellor. Many 
		hon. Members have commented that the Bill gives too many powers to the 
		Lord Chancellor. My view is that any man who compares himself with 
		Cardinal Wolsey probably deserves fewer rather than more powers, and 
		that the House should not consider passing any Act of Parliament that 
		might enhance his powers in any way. The Bill says, however, that the 
		Electoral Commission has to consider which of the existing electoral 
		regions in England and Wales should be combined with Gibraltar and, 
		before determining what recommendation to make to the Lord Chancellor, 
		consult with the Governor and the Chief Minister of Gibraltar. Under the 
		Bill, the Lord Chancellor also has an obligation to consult the 
		Electoral Commission. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">That raises a number 
		of questions, which I would be grateful if the Minister could answer. 
		First, what weight will the Government give to the opinion of the 
		Gibraltar Government - by which I mean the Chief Minister and the 
		Government, in particular, and not simply the Governor? The reason that 
		I ask the question in that form is that a press release of 22 
		November - the day on which the Bill was published, from the Gibraltar 
		Government makes it plain that the United Kingdom Government gave no 
		weight to the opinions of the Government of Gibraltar when they 
		presented the Bill to the House of Commons. The press release states:
		</p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;The Government&quot;, </p>
		
		<p class="speechbody">that is, the 
		Government of Gibraltar, </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">"has examined the European Parliament 
				(Representation) Bill published today by the British Government, 
				upon the text of which the Gibraltar Government has not been 
				consulted.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">There are two reasons 
		why that is strange. The first is that the British Government have made 
		a commitment to more pre-legislative scrutiny, that is, more 
		pre-consideration of Bills, so that they will be in better shape when 
		they come before the House. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Secondly, given the 
		thorough Horlicks that the British Government have made of their 
		relations with the Government of Gibraltar, one might have thought that, on a Bill of this importance to Gibraltar, 
		it might have been sensible to show the Gibraltar Government the 
		finished text of the draft Bill before presenting it to the House, and 
		to say, &quot;Here is our draft text; what do you think of it?&quot;. According to 
		the Government of Gibraltar, however, that was not done. An explanation 
		from the Minister for that would also be helpful. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">A further question 
		that I would like to raise is on the nature of the combined region and 
		how it will work in practice. With respect to what you said earlier, 
		Madam Deputy Speaker - of course, I respect your ruling. The way in which 
		the combined region that will include Gibraltar is to operate will 
		involve the existing electoral system, and this will highlight the 
		operation of that system more starkly than ever before. In my own 
		electoral region for the European Parliament - the eastern region - there 
		are eight MEPs. In the south-west, part of which is represented by my 
		hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), I think that there are 
		seven, and in Northern Ireland, three. I was particularly attracted to 
		the suggestions made by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon); 
		she made a very appealing case. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">So far as I 
		understand the Bill, the system will operate in exactly the same way in 
		the combined region, once Gibraltar has been incorporated into it, as it 
		does now in, shall we say, my own eastern region. Each of the eight MEPs 
		for that region, technically, is an MEP for the whole region. Similarly, 
		the seven MEPs for the south-west are all MEPs for all the south-west. 
		Thus, whichever combined region incorporates Gibraltar, all its MEPs 
		will represent Gibraltar. We already understand the difficulties that 
		this causes in practice. In my own area, the MEPs have informally cut up 
		the region territorially, just so that they can begin to get a grasp of 
		the job. I would be grateful if the Minister could address this issue, 
		specifically in relation to Gibraltar. How will this work? If all the MEPs from a region represent Gibraltar, will they all fly off there 
		regularly? Alternatively, will they simply have to cut up their region 
		and decide informally that only one of them should take responsibility 
		for the territory? If so, which one, and from which party? This raises 
		real concerns in relation to the operation of the combined region. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I am pleased to see 
		the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) in his place and 
		participating in this debate as a true Eurosceptic. I gather that, at a 
		tea party in his constituency a few months ago, he said that he had 
		always been against the single European currency. It is a great pleasure 
		to participate in a debate on the Floor of the House with him, when he 
		takes such an important position on such an important question. With 
		respect to his position on proportional representation, however, I 
		suggest that the question of how the combined region would operate 
		throws into stark relief the catastrophe that is proportional 
		representation. <br>
