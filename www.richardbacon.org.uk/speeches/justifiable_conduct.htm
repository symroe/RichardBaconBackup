		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given as part of a debate in 
			the House of Commons on 30 April 2004</cite></div>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk)</b> (Con): I am 
		a sponsor of the Bill. The hon. Members for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) 
		and for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) both referred repeatedly to jury trials, 
		but I think they miss the point. People feel that, in many cases, the 
		actions of a householder should not result in their ending up in court, 
		which is what often happens now. In addition, the fear that that might 
		happen is what restrains householders from acting when they ought to do 
		so and ought to be able to do so knowing that they are safe in the eyes 
		the law. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Part of the problem 
		is that the law at present is unclear. I refer to an article from <i>The 
		Daily Telegraph</i> of 2 December 2002 by Mr. Alan Judd. It refers to 
		three cases. In the first, a man was convicted for repeatedly stabbing a 
		burglar who had broken into the flat in which he believed his children 
		were sleeping. In the second, a man who felled a violent schizophrenic 
		who was strangling someone, then kicked him when he tried to get up and 
		resume, was arrested by the police - unlike the schizophrenic - and 
		prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service for kicking. In the 
		third, the hon. Member for Ealing, North may have been referring to this 
		case, a man stabbed to death one intruder and seriously wounded another, 
		and the CPS found his use of force to be reasonable. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Judd quotes an 
		article in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> by Mr. Alasdair Palmer, who wrote 
		that what such cases indicate is that the CPS </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;clearly can't decide where the boundary 
				between the reasonable and unreasonable use of force lies, and 
				thus what the law actually is&quot;. </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">Mr. Judd asks: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;How can it be right to prosecute people 
				when the law itself is confused and contradictory? If the 
				lawyers, safe in their offices, can't say what is right, how can 
				we be expected to weigh up the pros and cons during some 
				desperate struggle in the dark? Unclear law is unfair law.&quot; </p>
			</dir>
		</dir>
		<p class="speechbody">The hon. Member for 
		Broxtowe referred to certainty, and he is right: the Bill does provide a 
		much higher degree of certainty. If he wants to argue about that in more 
		detail, I should have thought that the place to do so is in Committee.
		</p>
		<p class="speechbody">I want to raise one 
		other issue, which involves the impact on rural areas. I represent a 
		very rural constituency of 350 square miles. To give the House some idea 
		of its size, the whole of Greater London has 74 constituencies in 650 
		square miles. Overnight in my constituency there are only two police 
		vehicles with four police officers on patrol. If someone is 
		apprehended, they have to be taken to Norwich or, worse, to King's Lynn 
		to be locked up as there are no custodial facilities elsewhere. It 
		requires only one call on the services of police officers to go into 
		Norwich and the whole southern sector of my constituency, an area of 270 
		square miles, which is equivalent to nearly half of Greater London, is 
		completely without police protection. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In Dickleburgh in my 
		constituency, just last Thursday a store was ram raided in the middle of 
		the night. The person who rented the flat above it alerted the police, 
		because he could hear what was going on, but he was told by the police 
		not to go downstairs and intervene in case he came under threat. 
		However, one reason that caused that person not to intervene was fear 
		that if he were to do so, he would be the one to be had up. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We need a shift in 
		the presumption away from the burglar or law-breaker and towards the 
		householder. There should be a strong presumption against prosecuting 
		any occupant who injures an assailant in some way while resisting the 
		intrusion into his or her home. That is essentially the point that my 
		hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) is making in the 
		Bill. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I have no doubt, my 
		hon. Friend admitted it, that the Bill could be improved. The place to 
		do that is in Committee, and I very much hope that the House will give 
		the Bill a chance to be considered there in more detail. The hon. 
		Members for Broxtowe and for Ealing, North, who have opposed the Bill, 
		have not said what they would do instead. They have both acknowledged 
		that there is a problem and that members of the public out there.</p>
	
		<p class="speechbody">Both hon. Members have 
		acknowledged that there is a problem, but they have not suggested what 
		they would do to combat it. I believe that it is for the House of 
		Commons to acknowledge the public concern, which is out there, and 
		respond to that by considering the Bill in detail in Committee. That is 
		what the public want.<br>
