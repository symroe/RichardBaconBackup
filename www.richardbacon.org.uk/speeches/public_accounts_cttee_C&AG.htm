		<p class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in the House of 
			Commons on 20 May 2009 as part of the debate on the appointment of 
		the new Comptroller and Auditor General</cite></p>
		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
					<p class="speechbody">
			<b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b><!--Mr. Richard Bacon--> 
			I am pleased to take part in the debate to confirm the appointment 
			of Mr. Morse as Comptroller and Auditor General. Having seen him in 
			the hearing, I have no doubt at all about his suitability. His 
			experience of running a large international accountancy practice, 
			PricewaterhouseCoopers, combined with his experience as commercial 
			director of the Ministry of Defence, renders him highly suitable for 
			this very difficult job.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Richard Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1527"-->
			In appointing Mr. Morse as Comptroller and Auditor General, the 
			Government are going to have to fix several things. It is a pleasure 
			to see a number of former members of the Public Accounts Committee 
			now sitting on the Treasury Bench and taking part in the debate. I 
			saw the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett) earlier. When he 
			was a member of the Committee, I always used to feel that he and I 
			were hunting together as a pack when we were probing the civil 
			servants before us. Unfortunately, he is now engaged on other 
			responsibilities&#8212;bunker maintenance might be the best description 
			for them. There are others sitting on the Treasury Bench who have 
			had recent PAC experience. I enjoyed their incisive contributions 
			through the years when they were members.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Richard Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1527"-->
			There are aspects of the Comptroller and Auditor General&#8217;s access to 
			the information he needs that will have to be fixed. The National 
			Audit Act 1983 states that the Comptroller and Auditor General 
			should have complete discretion in the exercise of his functions. 
			One might assume that this is completely true, but in fact it is not 
			true at all, as there are three obvious exceptions.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Richard Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1527"-->
			The first is the Financial Services Authority, to which the 
			Comptroller and Auditor General does not have access. That means 
			that he cannot carry out an audit of the effectiveness, efficiency 
			and economy of the FSA in the way he can with, say, the Ministry of 
			Defence or the Department of Health. I personally believe that that 
			has had significant consequences&#8212;for example, in respect of Northern 
			Rock. When it got into huge difficulties, it was discovered to be 
			subject to a regulatory system under which the different players did 
			not know what they were doing. It became very obvious in the autumn 
			of 2007, as seen in the National Audit Office report based on 
			evidence from the Comptroller Auditor General,
			that the three parts of the regulatory system did not know what the 
			others were doing. That was the result of a lack of scrutiny of the 
			FSA. The Comptroller and Auditor General would have carried it out, 
			I believe, if he had had the right of access to do so&#8212;but he did 
			not, so when it was done, it was done by the Treasury.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Richard Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"-->
			I am afraid that only once over a period of seven or eight years did 
			the Treasury ask the NAO to look at the activities of the FSA. In 
			that regard, it failed in its functions. I do not blame the 
			Exchequer Secretary, who was a very incisive member of our Committee 
			when she was on it. Functionally, however, the Treasury has failed, 
			and Sir Nicholas Macpherson has more or less admitted that point and 
			agreed to go back and look over the matter.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Richard Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"-->
			Secondly&#8212;</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"--><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir 
			Michael Lord):</b><!--Mr. Deputy Speaker--> Order. I think the hon. 
			Gentleman is ranging rather wide of the measure before the House, 
			which is specifically about an appointment.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"--><b>Mr. Bacon:</b><!--Mr. Bacon--> 
			Indeed, Mr. Deputy Speaker, so I shall try to confine my remarks to 
			the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General. In talking 
			about that appointment, I hope it is in order to discuss the 
			functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General once he is 
			appointed and whether or not he is able to exercise them.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"--><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b><!--Mr. Deputy Speaker--> 
			Perhaps&#8212;narrowly and briefly.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"--><b>Mr. Bacon:</b><!--Mr. Bacon--> 
			I will be very narrow and very brief, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"-->
			My second point concerns the BBC, to which the Comptroller and 
			Auditor General does not have access either. That has an impact on 
			the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the BBC and on the 
			extent to which it is scrutinised. When Dame Ellen MacArthur sailed 
			around the world, 64 television producers turned up in Falmouth to 
			cover it. I am not sure that that would have happened if they had 
			known that they were going to be subject to public audit in the way 
			that most Government Departments are. That has nothing to do with 
			editorial control.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"-->
			The third point, and it is the most serious of all, concerns this 
			House. I hope that you will agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that it is 
			directly relevant to this debate. What better time to appoint the 
			nation&#8217;s chief auditor than after what has happened over the last 
			couple of weeks? I can think of no more important appointment for us 
			to make. According to statute, the Comptroller and Auditor General 
			has all the authority over the National Audit Office. As the 
			Government well know, that is why we are soon going to see changes. 
			As I say, the Comptroller and Auditor General has all the authority 
			under statute and the NAO is organised under his control into 
			value-for-money divisions and financial audit divisions.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"--><b>Mr. Leigh:</b><!--Mr. Leigh--> 
			Will my hon. Friend allow me?</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"--><b>Mr. Bacon:</b><!--Mr. Bacon--> 
			I would rather keep going, if I may, as Mr. Deputy Speaker has asked 
			me to be brief.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1528"-->
			As it is organised, the Defence, Health or Transport audit will have 
			two sub-branches: financial and value for money. Within the NAO, 
			there is also a section called &#8220;Justice and Parliament&#8221;&#8212;and I had 
			always 
			assumed that the Justice and Parliament section could audit the 
			House of Commons administration in exactly the same way as the 
			Health audit section can audit the Department of Health or as the 
			Culture, Media and Sport section or the Transport section can audit 
			those Government Departments. It turns out, however, not to be the 
			case.</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1529"-->
			I discussed this issue with an assistant Comptroller and Auditor 
			General last week. Previously, I had always thought that the 
			auditors could go in and examine the House of Commons administration 
			and do all the audit they needed to perform to satisfy themselves in 
			exactly the same way as for Departments. It turns out, however, that 
			for all these years, all they have been able to do is to compare the 
			claims made by Members with the amounts paid and check that the two 
			are the same&#8212;that is all they can do. When I asked one of the 
			assistant auditors general why it was not possible to do more, the 
			reply was, &#8220;That is all we could get.&#8221;</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="1529"-->
			I hope that you will agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that what I am 
			saying now is directly relevant to this debate and to the 
			appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The truth is 
			that that is not good enough. It is not the fault of the Comptroller 
			and Auditor General that it is not good enough, as it is the 
			responsibility of the Government and this House. When the Government 
			fix the problem, they have to ensure that the new Comptroller and 
			Auditor General we are appointing&#8212;I think he is the right person for 
			the job&#8212;has all the access he needs to do the job properly.</p>
