		<div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify">
		
		
		
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b> 
		It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland 
		(Helen Goodman), who provided the House with a penetrating analysis of 
		the Committee's work, and of some of the issues and problems with which 
		it has to deal. I agree with a great deal of what she said. She 
		certainly does not sound like a new member of the Committee, but of 
		course, she was a Treasury official for a while. We also know - I am not 
		sure that she knows that we know - that she was the original teenage 
		scribbler. She has now been promoted from scribbling to offering 
		penetrating analysis, and we welcome her and the other new members of 
		the Committee to their positions. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Helen 
		Goodman: </b>I should point out that I was not a 
		scribbler; I was the original teenage kid. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon: </b>The hon. Lady was a deputy scribbler, 
		perhaps. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Like 
		the hon. Lady, I want to pay tribute to Nick Wright, Chris Randall, Emma 
		Sawyer and Ronnie Jefferson, who run the Committee's office; to the 
		press office of the National Audit Office, which is headed by Barry 
		Lester, with able support from Mark Strathdene and others; and to the 
		office of Sir John Bourn himself. I should point out by way of 
		correction that members of the NAO are not civil servants and that in 
		fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General is an Officer of the House of 
		Commons. That is of incalculable importance. Even if it is a 
		constitutional nicety, it says something very important about the way in 
		which the system is structured. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I 
		want to focus on private finance initiatives, particularly those 
		relating to hospitals. The Committee has examined a wide range of PFI 
		projects and a wide range of hospitals. We have looked at the Darent 
		Valley hospital and the Dartford and Gravesham hospital. We visited the 
		UCL hospitals and recently examined the Norfolk and Norwich hospital, 
		which is in my own area. The issues associated with hospital procurement 
		illustrate some important themes that merit further scrutiny and 
		discussion not only by the Committee, but by the Treasury. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We 
		are all familiar with the standard PFI model as it has developed. It 
		started out as a design, build, finance and operate model, whereby the 
		Government said to operators, &quot;Go off and do it, and tell us when you've 
		done it.&quot; There have been many successes; indeed, not even critics of 
		PFI would deny that an increasing number of buildings have been 
		delivered on time and on budget, with substantially reduced, if not 
		completely eliminated, cost overruns. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The 
		NAO's figures show that, in 2001, 76 per cent. of projects were 
		delivered on time and 79 per cent. to budget. That compares with 30 per 
		cent. on time and 27 per cent. to budget for conventional procurement. 
		More recent Treasury figures tell an even better story, with 88 per 
		cent. of projects delivered on time and 79 per cent. to budget. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">We 
		all know examples of conventional procurements that have gone horribly 
		wrong - the Jubilee line extension, the British Library, the Scottish 
		Parliament building, and even Portcullis house. In the latter case, all 
		kinds of problems were encountered. The wrong kind of bronze was used on 
		the roof, and the windows cost £23 million more than they were supposed 
		to. The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects told me 
		recently that it would have been cheaper to clad the exterior of 
		Portcullis house with 7-series BMWs. That shows the scale of the 
		problems that conventional procurement can encounter, and that PFI has 
		offered a successful alternative in many cases. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">There is no doubt that PFI has led to significant improvements, or that 
		it is here to stay. The question is whether we are getting the best 
		possible value from the way that PFI procurement is conducted. There is 
		growing evidence that we are not, a conclusion that is especially well 
		illustrated by PFI hospital procurement. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Many 
		of the problems have to do with design, and they could be avoided with 
		more thought and a better assessment of requirements in the early phase 
		of procurement. For example, the Cumberland infirmary in Carlisle was a 
		45-year contract costing £65 million. The contract called for a 474-bed 
		hospital, but the new infirmary has a capacity of 444 beds. Floor 
		capacity in the old sites that it replaced amounted to 57,000 sq ft, but 
		the new site has only 42,000 sq ft. The infirmary has been criticised 
		for having cheap components that need refitting at short intervals. The 
		maintenance costs are 50 per cent. over projections, there is poor 
		drainage and plumbing, and limited signage. Patients exiting cardiology 
		have to go through five sets of swing doors, even though most of them 
		are in wheelchairs. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The 
		new 450-bed district general hospital in Durham was built on the Dryburn 
		site to rationalise services provided previously at Shotley Bridge and 
		the old Dryburn hospital. There, the pathology lab flooded three times 
		in the first 18 months, twice with raw sewage. There is poor ventilation 
		and air filtration and the fixtures and fittings are of poor quality. 
		Some of the lightweight storage cupboards are unable to take the weight 
		of routine equipment. <br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		The opening of the hospital in Bishop Auckland, in the constituency of 
		the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland, was delayed by two months for 
		modifications. The generator and the core electrical systems had to be 
		redesigned immediately after the hospital opened. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The 
		Norfolk and Norwich university hospital is on the border of my 
		constituency. Most of my constituents go there for medical treatment, 
		and many work there. The negative pressure rooms were not properly 
		operational for two years. A nurse lifted ceiling tiles in third-floor 
		ward areas and found air ducting lying in unconnected lengths. The job 
		simply had not been finished. I am pleased to say that the hospital has 
		since spent some money on modifying those rooms and they are fully 
		operational, but other problems remain. For example, there is no 
		ventilation in the kitchens: 30° C working conditions are common, and a 
		temperature of 44° C has been recorded. In addition, delivery loading 
		bays are inefficient, and there are numerous reports of health and 
		safety problems due to layout and the poor materials used in 
		construction. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">When 
		it is published, the separate PAC report on refinancing will reveal some 
		startling facts about the financial engineering used, not to increase 
		the number of beds or to build a new wing, but solely to accelerate the 
		rate of financial return, from 18 per cent. to over 60 per cent. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The 
		new Hereford hospital has 354 beds. The boiler house opened with no 
		water treatment plant. There were materials defects, doors were too 
		heavy for the opening restraints. Engineering workshops designed for 
		five staff regularly have 13 people working in them, and three lifts had 
		to be refitted within the first 12 months. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">I 
		turn now to Worcestershire, a county for which I have a particular 
		affection, as I had my appendix taken out in a hospital there some years 
		ago. In the Worcestershire acute hospitals NHS trust's modern, 452-bed 
		facility, the back office conditions are too cramped. Corridors are too 
		narrow to pass two beds side by side. There is also an inefficient and 
		unused one-way system. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">It 
		is worth saying that these are not just snagging issues that occur with 
		any new building. They are design problems. It is not normal to refit 
		three lifts in the first 12 months. One does not redesign the generator 
		and the core electrical systems immediately after opening a new hospital 
		and call it snagging. Corridors that are too narrow to pass two beds 
		side by side are not a snagging problem. A pathology lab that floods 
		three times in 18 months, including with raw sewage, is not a snagging 
		problem. They are fundamental signs of poor specification and design. 
		The current PFI procurement process makes such design more likely, not 
		less. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">As 
		well as inadequate quality, we are also seeing spiralling costs. The 
		average cost of bidding for a PFI hospital has risen from £7.5 million 
		two years ago - itself an extraordinary figure - to more than £11.5 million 
		now. RIBA believes that a conservative estimate of the cost of abortive 
		bids is about £500 million per annum across the sector. As part of the 
		company's operational profitability, that inevitably gets rolled into 
		the cost of the losing consortium's next bid. Even the winning 
		consortium is likely to have factored in the cost of its previous 
		unsuccessful bids. <br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		The process is simply making the whole industry more expensive. It is 
		also excluding many capable medium-sized contractors. In effect, it is a 
		Government-sponsored oligopoly. It is wasteful. Parallel teams work up 
		designs that require a considerable amount of professional time and 
		skill at a time when, as the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland said, there 
		is an acute skills shortage. It is worse than that, because the most 
		expert clients are the ones who can recruit the best designers, who then 
		compete with each other while the other bids have less experienced 
		designers, leading to lower overall quality of design. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Once 
		a consortium has won, another key question arises that, in some ways, is 
		even worse in terms of its consequences, namely, who, then, is the 
		client? The client is not who one would think it would be. It is not the 
		hospital trust; the designer's client is the consortium. So there will 
		be pressures. A marked degradation has been seen on many occasions in 
		the design quality after financial close. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Helen Goodman: </b>Does the 
		hon. Gentleman agree that part of the issue is not the overall cost but 
		the point at which we are spending money on big projects? We are not 
		spending it early enough. We are not investing early enough in skills 
		within the public sector. Hence, we find ourselves spending more later 
		on. </p>
		<p class="speechbody"><b>Mr. 
		Bacon: </b>We find ourselves spending more later on in 
		spades, and wastefully. In the recent exercise with St. Mary's, 
		Paddington, the bidding round failed, cost £50 million and produced 
		nothing of worth. They are having to go back and do it all again. We 
		recently heard about the problems with Bart's, with potentially £100 
		million of fees lost. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The 
		hon. Lady anticipates a point that I intended to make later by drawing 
		an analogy with the way in which defence procurement works. As we have 
		said in some of our reports, the assessment phase should receive a 
		greater proportion of the resource that goes into the project. Designers 
		are having to respond to pressures from the leaders of consortiums, who 
		are usually a combination of the building contractors and the banks, to 
		build to the lowest cost or to facilitate the easiest building method. 
		That may be sensible or it may be in the best interests not of the 
		client but of the consortium that has to deliver it. The client is 
		interested in the best possible hospital within the available budget for 
		patients. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The 
		problems are so widespread that the Treasury cannot say that it is not a 
		problem and neither can anyone else. It is a significant problem. The 
		question is what do we do about it? RIBA, along with others, has evolved 
		what it thinks may be part of the answer. It has called it smart 
		procurement, which leads directly to the point that the hon. Member for 
		Bishop Auckland was making. In smart acquisition, part of the emphasis 
		is on spending more of the resource earlier. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In 
		our third report of the 2005-06 Session, HC410, we said in terms: </p>
		<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt">&quot;The amount of work 
		undertaken in the assessment phase is still not sufficient to enable 
		sensible investment decisions to be taken . The Department's own Smart 
		Acquisition guideline suggests that up to 15 per cent. of the cost of a 
		project should be spent in the assessment phase.&quot;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">That is for defence procurement. I do not want to 
		promulgate a particular percentage, but it is clear that the point is 
		analogous to what is going on in PFI hospitals. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">Essentially, it is about getting the design team much nearer to the 
		client. I have talked to the institute and it does not appear to be a 
		case of architects or other professionals talking up their own book, 
		which might be expected from any professional body. That is not what the 
		institute means. It means getting civil engineers, quantity surveyors 
		and others to work closely with the relevant hospital trust at a much 
		earlier stage to eliminate problems by having a much closer 
		understanding much earlier of what is required. That effectively allows 
		the client to drive the process more strongly, with greater information 
		and control, and power over the outcome. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">In 
		that context, it is interesting to consider the situation in Northern 
		Ireland. As the Chairman said earlier, we have had many reasons to look 
		at Northern Ireland, including the Navan centre, the sheep annual 
		premium scheme and the recent job skills project. Many of the projects 
		we have looked at have been a disgrace, but the Department for Health, 
		Social Services and Public Safety, especially the Health Estates Agency 
		under the management of John Cole, is blazing a trail. Because of the 
		slightly different context in Northern Ireland, it has gone further down 
		the path and I urge the Financial Secretary and other Ministers to 
		examine what has been done there and whether the rest of the UK could 
		learn some lessons about how PFI can be conducted. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">The 
		issue is not only about designers: it is about the whole built 
		environment sector coming together to produce better outcomes for 
		taxpayers. The initiative that the institute has evolved is now at an 
		advanced stage and preliminary discussions have already taken place with 
		the Treasury. The institute has talked to public sector clients, 
		building contractors, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, building 
		surveyors, facilities managers, insurers and banks, and is looking to 
		produce a final cross-industry position paper. My plea to the Financial 
		Secretary is that the Treasury should engage with the process seriously. 
		These are welcome moves by the industry to produce a better, more mature 
		and more efficient PFI market. I urge the Financial Secretary to meet 
		the main players who, in my view, are seeking genuinely to eliminate 
		problems and produce better results to turn PFI into something that 
		delivers even more value for taxpayers who are, after all, paying for 
		it. </p>
