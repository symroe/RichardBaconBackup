		<b>Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</b><!--Mr. Richard Bacon-->
		It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West 
		(Mr. Davidson), who is one of the most fearless of our interrogators, 
		and sometimes one of the funniest of our members. I regret that the name 
		of his constituency changed from Glasgow, Pollok to Glasgow, South-West 
		because we always liked saying Glasgow, Pollok. I know little about his 
		constituency except that I am fairly sure he has very few barristers as 
		constituents&#8212;<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="509"-->
		<b>Angela Browning:</b><!--Angela Browning--> Or farmers.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="509"--><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b><!--Mr. Bacon--> And very few farmers&#8212;</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="509"--><b>Mr. 
		Leigh:</b><!--Mr. Leigh--> Or members of the royal family.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="509"--><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b><!--Mr. Bacon--> Indeed. The hon. Member for Glasgow, 
		South-West did not actually say just now that all farmers are thieves, 
		but I have heard him say that before; and he did say on the record that 
		barristers are thieves.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="509"-->
		The hon. Gentleman also said that the right balance had to be struck 
		between talking about reports to the Committee in a way that was not too 
		party political and getting enough attention paid to the issue. It is 
		something I am aware of every time I broadcast on the Committee&#8217;s work. 
		If I am being critical, I try to be critical of the Department 
		concerned. The hon. Gentleman used the word &#8220;dull&#8221;, and one tries to 
		make comments sound non-party political. I go out of my way to avoid 
		ever using the phrase &#8220;the Labour party&#8221; when I am broadcasting about 
		Committee matters, because that would simply be inappropriate. Were 
		there to be a change of Government at some point, which is possible, I 
		hope that the same thing would apply if the hon. Gentleman were 
		broadcasting in that way as an Opposition Member.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="509"-->
		In the same spirit, there might be occasions when the hon. Gentleman 
		should think about tempering his words. I represent a lot of farmers, 
		and they are not all rapacious. He will remember the National Audit 
		Office report, and our Committee report, on the case of Joseph Bowden. 
		He was a farmer claiming money under the arable area payments scheme and 
		the fibre flax scheme for territories&#8212;I use that word advisedly&#8212;that on 
		closer examination, when one used the entire grid reference rather than 
		part of it, which is all the form had required him to fill in, turned 
		out in one case to be in the North sea between Scotland and Denmark and, 
		in another, to be on the mainland of Greenland. That fraud was brought 
		to the attention of the authorities, not because of the diligence of the 
		Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as it then was, but because 
		of another farmer who realised what was going on and thought that 
		something was odd.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="510"-->
		I also regret that the Committee only narrowly failed to pass a 
		resolution when we had the Duke of Westminster in front of us, as the 
		Assistant Chief of Defence Staff, requiring the hon. Member for Glasgow, 
		South-West to address him as &#8220;Your grace&#8221; each time he spoke to him, but 
		that is, unfortunately, now water under the bridge.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="510"-->
		I wondered which of the various reports I should focus on. I started the 
		day reeling under the impact of the National Offender Management Service 
		information system report published by the NAO. Although that report is 
		outside the scope of this debate, as we have not even had a hearing on 
		it, many of its themes are relevant not only to the reports before us 
		today, but to the Committee&#8217;s work in general. The National Audit 
		Office, together with the Office of Government Commerce, agreed in 2002 
		a list of eight of the most common causes of project failure. The first 
		was the lack of a clear link between the project&#8212;whatever it was&#8212;and the 
		organisation&#8217;s key strategic priorities, including agreed measures of 
		success. The second was a lack of clear senior management and 
		ministerial ownership and leadership&#8212;we certainly saw that in the case 
		of the Rural Payments Agency, and in that of the shared services report 
		from the Department for Transport. The third was a lack of effective 
		engagement with stakeholders&#8212;we have seen that in many reports. The 
		fourth was a lack of skills and a proven approach to project management 
		and risk management. The fifth was too little attention to breaking down 
		the development and implementation of projects into manageable steps. 
		The sixth was that the evolution of proposals were driven by the initial 
		price, rather than by considerations of longer-term value for money, 
		especially the delivery of business benefits. The seventh was a lack of 
		understanding of and contact with the supply industry at senior levels 
		of the organisation, and the eighth was a lack of an effective project 
		team working with the clients, supply team and supply chain.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="510"-->
		The report published this morning happened to touch on almost all those 
		factors, in full or in part, but they are common themes we see again and 
		again in different reports. One thing that I hope the Minister will find 
		time to do is to address the role of the Office of Government Commerce 
		in scrutinising and challenging the management of Government projects 
		and in ensuring that Departments are steering projects properly, because 
		I do not think that there is nearly enough evidence to convince us that 
		the system is working properly. The OGC gives advice, for sure, but time 
		and again that advice is put to one side or ignored.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="510"-->
		The Minister will know that applications to the fast track of the civil 
		service are up 30 per cent., which is good news for the civil service. 
		It is unsurprising that that should be the case in these straitened 
		financial times. It gives the civil service a better choice from among 
		those talented graduates, and that is good news. However, I want to know 
		what the civil service is doing at the centre to ensure that the 
		principles of project management and risk management&#8212;all the things that 
		the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West described as being seen to be 
		rather dull in some cases, but which are incredibly important for the 
		successful delivery of projects&#8212;are tattooed on the eyelids of new 
		entrants to the civil service so that they understand as they join that 
		effective project management and focusing on outcomes are important from 
		that moment on. They need to understand that the civil service is not 
		only about policy advice but, as the Committee Chairman said earlier, 
		about successfully delivering projects. I would be grateful for the 
		Minister&#8217;s comments on that.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="511"-->
		Our report on the roll-out of Jobcentre Plus speaks on that theme. As 
		was mentioned earlier, the key staff included Mrs. Lesley Strathie, who 
		is now chief executive of HMRC and who started as a clerical assistant 
		in 1974. I was very pleased, as it was a point that I made in the 
		Committee, that one of the recommendations of our report noted the need 
		to focus on the fact that key leadership roles should be taken by people 
		with significant front-line experience who had started at the bottom. 
		The three witnesses had a total of 112 years of experience between them, 
		and because they had started at the bottom, as the poor bloody infantry, 
		they were going to ensure that no project was imposed in a way that 
		could not work at grass-roots level. That was welcome.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="511"-->
		That goes back to the Fulton report and the way its proposals were 
		eventually defeated by William Armstrong, who was then head of the civil 
		service, ensuring that the generalist stream of the civil service 
		remained on top. That has been a 30 or 40-year failure across successive 
		Governments, and I would be interested to hear the Minister&#8217;s comments 
		on it. I think we are now getting a little more expertise. I always read 
		the CVs of our witnesses, and more and more of them come from the 
		private sector, or have at least some private sector background, which 
		is interesting. They also seem to have genuine expertise in the subject 
		that they are appearing before us to discuss. That is most welcome, but 
		I would like to know what that says about fast-track entry and how it 
		will be integrated into the recruitment process for the future.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="511"-->
		I also wanted to make a point about the report on the Revenue and 
		Customs prosecutions office. David Green, QC, was hired to be director 
		of the prosecutions office, not because he had management experience or 
		knew how to run a budget or how to procure and deliver an IT system, but 
		because he was one of the leading criminal barristers in this country 
		specialising in Revenue work. That was an ideal background for somebody 
		to become director of the Revenue and Customs prosecutions office. He is 
		a leading silk in his area, but that does not mean that the Treasury or 
		civil service, in giving him the responsibilities of an accounting 
		officer, which include ensuring that there is probity in the use of 
		public money and that the proper systems are in place, can assume that a 
		man who is extremely talented in his field will have the requisite 
		expertise in what one might call general management. I asked Mr. Green 
		whether he was familiar with the Treasury document on the 
		responsibilities of an accounting officer, and he said that he had been 
		given it and that he had been on a training course. I asked how long the 
		training course had lasted, and he said, &#8220;Half a day.&#8221;</p>
		<p class="speechbody">think I am right in saying that the Treasury 
		minute in response to the report acknowledges that more must be done for 
		people from different backgrounds who come in as accounting officers. I 
		am glad that that recommendation has been made, although it is slightly 
		worrying that it was necessary. Perhaps it is a consequence of the fact 
		that more people from different backgrounds are coming in from outside 
		the civil service, but it is something that it is important to bear in 
		mind.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="512"-->
		Finally, I want to focus on the comments made by the hon. Member for 
		Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) about the use of consultants. A lot of 
		flannel is talked about this subject. I have an interest, in that many 
		years ago&#8212;in the mid-1990s, when there was a Conservative Government&#8212;I 
		was employed for two years by the trade body representing the consulting 
		industry. I remember someone who worked for one of our member firms 
		saying that he was looking forward to a Labour Government being elected, 
		because that would mean more work for consultants. I asked why that 
		would be, and was told that consultants always get more work whenever 
		there is change. Of course, there has been a great deal more work for 
		consultants since then.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="512"-->
		The public sector needs to be very careful about when it uses 
		consultants. Of course, consultants have been used for a variety of 
		purposes in many of the reports before us. We should not dismiss the 
		possibility of using them, but nor should we assume that must use them.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="512"-->
		There are three classic reasons for using consultants&#8212;first, because 
		they have an expertise unavailable elsewhere: secondly, because a 
		temporary shortage needs to be filled on an interim basis; and thirdly, 
		because an independent view is required. Those three reasons always 
		apply in the commercial or private sector, but in the public sector one 
		would hope that the independent view came more often from the civil 
		service. </p>
		<p class="speechbody">However, the knee-jerk tendency that emerged under 
		the previous Conservative Government, and which has continued under this 
		Government, is to reach for consultants. That is because they provide an 
		external and apparently independent endorsement of something that 
		Ministers do not have the confidence to take forward solely on the basis 
		of civil service advice.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="512"-->
		Ministers use consultants for another reason&#8212;doing so allows them to say 
		publicly, &#8220;Well, this is what KPMG has said,&#8221; as though what KPMG says 
		were a mantra that cannot be disproved. We must be very careful about 
		that, but we must also recognise that there are plenty of occasions&#8212;and 
		I mentioned the building of motorways&#8212;when one would want to employ 
		someone on a temporary rather than permanent basis. When we do that, 
		however, we must make sure that the proper skills are transferred.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="512"-->
		Although I do not go quite as far as my Taliban Friend the hon. Member 
		for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) in the use of ideological language about the 
		corporate state, I have a sneaking sympathy for some of what he said 
		about the use of big firms.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="512"-->
		I met representatives of Microsoft this morning. It is a very big firm, 
		but I was surprised and interested to hear that its representatives were 
		worried about the failure of the public sector to hire small and 
		medium-sized enterprises, especially in the IT sector. Because of what 
		it does and supplies, Microsoft gets a lot of business from small and 
		medium-sized entrepreneurial companies that use their products to 
		develop other things for the public sector.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="513"-->
		One point made to me was that the Government are not very good at using 
		SMEs, especially in the IT area, even though they may have fantastic 
		products offering technically advanced solutions and often very good 
		value for money. I know that the Government are aware of that, and I 
		should be interested to hear the Minister&#8217;s comments on what more can be 
		done.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="513"-->
		I fully accept that there may not always be an alternative to using a 
		big consultancy firm like KPMG or PricewaterhouseCoopers to deliver a 
		big project, and projects set up by the Department for Work and Pensions 
		would be a classic example of that. In the negotiations that have to 
		take place, a big company can tell the Government that it is able to put 
		1,000 people on the project, with the result that civil servants are 
		reassured that it has the necessary clout.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="513"-->
		However, it seems to me&#8212;and this is where I have some sympathy with my 
		hon. Friend the Member for Harwich&#8212;that the other side of the coin is 
		that the big firm has 1,000 people on its payroll whom it has to put on 
		a job somewhere. There is almost a kind of oligopoly at work, and if we 
		are not careful it can shut out the smaller and more agile suppliers 
		that may be able to provide taxpayers with much better value for money.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="513"--><b>Angela 
		Eagle:</b><!--Angela Eagle--> I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises 
		that the Government have accepted all the recommendations in the Glover 
		report, which was published at the time of the last Budget. They are 
		well on the way to being put into effect, and we hope that all of them 
		will be adopted by the beginning of next year. That should make access 
		to the large amounts of Government procurement that arise every year 
		much easier and simpler for SMEs.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="513"--><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b><!--Mr. Bacon--> I am grateful to the Minister for that 
		intervention; it is good that she has put that on the record. Of course, 
		the Government are aware of the problem, but a series of steps needs to 
		be taken between being aware of the problem and ensuring that it is 
		solved on the ground.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="513"--><b>Dr. Pugh:</b><!--Dr. Pugh--> 
		The hon. Gentleman mentioned Microsoft. He will be aware of course that, 
		in the Building Schools for the Future programme, small to medium-sized 
		enterprises&#8212;IT companies&#8212;had grave difficulty getting a look in, whereas 
		Microsoft has got its feet well under the table. So I hope that he will 
		not take its protestations too seriously.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="513"--><b>Mr. 
		Bacon:</b><!--Mr. Bacon--> When anyone comes to see us, we naturally 
		think that they will have a vested interest. I am reminded of the 
		diaries of the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), which 
		were published yesterday and in which he said that one of his first 
		steps was to see no vested interests of any kind when he became a junior 
		Minister. That did not last. Richard Branson wrote to the Prime Minister 
		and was passed on to the Foreign Secretary, and when the issue was 
		finally passed to the hon. Member for Sunderland, South, he felt unable 
		to say no to meeting Mr. Branson.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="513"-->
		Of course, the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) is right. All 
		companies have their own commercial interests, and it is quite right 
		that they do their best to protect them. He mentioned Building Schools 
		for the Future, which raises another issue about consultancy, on which I 
		will finish. We had that hearing only a few months ago, so the issue is 
		not yet before us in a Treasury minute. The average salary of the 
		employees of Building Schools for the Future is £85,000, which is pretty 
		high. It has 111 employees. Hon. Members might think that the reason why 
		they have high salaries&#8212;indeed, this is the reason given&#8212;is that they 
		are all specialists and therefore such salaries are needed to attract 
		them.</p>
		<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. Bacon"--><!--meta name="Colno" CONTENT="514"-->
		The permanent secretary said that there is a market in such things. 
		Perhaps he is right&#8212;one assumes that he is&#8212;but people might assume that, 
		if there were a lot of in-house expertise, consultants would not be used 
		so much. Yet since that body has been established, it has spent nearly 
		£6 million on consultancy. In the past year alone, it has spent £750,000 
		on consultants and, when asked about that, those involved said, &#8220;Oh, 
		that&#8217;s mostly for lawyers.&#8221; Why are the schemes so complex that people 
		cannot bid for them without enormously thick contracts? The average cost 
		of bidding for a Building Schools for the Future contract is about £1 
		million, which, admittedly, is a lot less than the cost of bidding for a 
		PFI hospital, at £11 million, but that goes back to the point about 
		oligopoly&#8212;people are possibly being shut out, and the Government, on 
		behalf of taxpayers, must always be aware of that.</p>
