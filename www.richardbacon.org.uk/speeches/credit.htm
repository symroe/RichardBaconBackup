		<div class="asublist"><cite>This speech was given in the chamber of the 
			House of Commons as part of the debate on the second reading of the 
			Consumer Credit Bill, on
			9 June 2005</cite></div>
		<br><div class="speechbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>
			<span lang="EN">Mr. Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con):</span></b><span lang="EN"> 
			I am pleased to have the chance briefly to contribute to the debate.
			</span>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I congratulate my hon. Friend 
			the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) on his excellent maiden 
			speech. He has already made a distinguished contribution to the 
			Conservative party as director of policy - some might say that a 
			little more work remains to be done given the evidence of the past 
			few weeks - and I read many of the research department's products when 
			he was in charge. I am sure that we will hear more from him. </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I also congratulate my hon. 
			Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) on her maiden 
			speech. Not only were we at university together, to which she 
			alluded, but I shared a flat with her husband, and her daughter, 
			Georgia Charlotte Mary Miller, is my goddaughter. I am biased in her 
			favour and congratulate her on having arrived here. She may be 
			charming, but she has inner steel and determination - she has not only 
			run a successful and happy family with three children over the past 
			15 to 20 years, but had an outstanding business career. I am sure 
			that she will make a wonderful contribution to this House. </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I have listened to the debate 
			with interest and particularly enjoyed the contribution by the right 
			hon. Member for Leeds, West (John Battle) - I hope that the Minister 
			was listening carefully, and I think that he was. If we want to 
			restore people's faith in the House of Commons, we could do no more 
			than play the tape of the right hon. Gentleman's speech, which was 
			passionate, highly informed and persuasive. I hope that the Minister 
			will listen carefully to the right hon. Gentleman in Committee.
			</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">I want to deal with a couple 
			of issues that have already been alluded to, the first of which is 
			the question whether the definition of &quot;unfairness&quot; should be 
			tighter. On the face of it, I agree with the Minister that the 
			definition should not be too precise. Clause 19, which deals with 
			unfair relationships between creditors and debtors, appears to give 
			the court everything that it could possibly want: </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;The court may make an order . . . if it determines that the 
			relationship between the creditor and the debtor arising out of the 
			agreement . . . is unfair to the debtor because of . . . any of the 
			terms of the agreement or of any related agreement; the way in which 
			the creditor has exercised or enforced any of his rights under the 
			agreement or any related agreement&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">or, and one could not ask for 
			a greater carte blanche than this, </span></p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">
			&quot;any other thing done (or not done) by, or on behalf of, the 
			creditor (either before or after the making of the agreement or any 
			related agreement).&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">At least on the face of it, 
			that would seem to provide the court with everything that it needs, 
			but my concern, to echo the right hon. Member for Leeds, West, is 
			about cases that do not arrive in court. We are not talking about 
			equal parties here. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">That also relates to the point 
			about retrospection. Generally speaking, as I think my hon. Friend 
			the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) would agree, we would be 
			hesitant about retrospective legislation because one of the key 
			principles of the law is not only equality before the law, but 
			certainty. One might think that a clause that states that </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><span lang="EN">&quot;A 
			determination may be made under this section in relation to a 
			relationship notwithstanding that the relationship may have ended&quot;</span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">would be deeply damaging to 
			any sense of certainty between two parties entering into an 
			agreement. Instinctively, I would be much less worried about 
			retrospective legislation in this context than in some others, 
			because it does not deal with parties who are equal in any way 
			whatsoever, but with people who are often at the very bottom end of 
			the income scale - people who live in grinding poverty with the 
			greatest difficulty in getting by, as we have heard, not just from 
			week to week but from day to day, and who live in fear with debt 
			collectors already knocking on their doors. That must be recognised 
			in the Bill so that the courts will understand that Parliament 
			enacted it in order to stand up for the little people, not the big 
			people. </span></p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">My experience as a 
			constituency MP suggests to me that the problem exists not only at 
			the bottom end of the scale but in the middle, where respectable, or 
			so-called respectable, financial institutions deal with people who 
			have modest incomes but some savings. In such cases, the scales are 
			weighted too much in favour of the financial institution. I have 
			often dealt with the financial services ombudsman - I am sure that 
			other Members have had similar experiences - and sometimes think, 
			&quot;Whose side are you on?&quot; The idea is supposedly to help the little 
			person, not the big institution. I was involved in a case involving 
			Abbey National that has still not been resolved satisfactorily. On 4 
			April, I had an Adjournment debate in this House on a case of cheque 
			fraud on which the Financial Services Authority has failed to act in 
			the 18 months since the loophole was exposed. Anybody could still do 
			today what was done to many constituents of mine who lost hundreds 
			of thousands of pounds. The regulatory environment is often far from 
			fair in paying sufficient heed to the needs of consumers. </span>
			</p>
			<p class="speechbody"><span lang="EN">Of course we want equality and 
			certainty before the law, but we also want justice. There has been a 
			general recognition, in successive Governments' approach to 
			regulation, that wholesale credit markets or wholesale credit 
			derivative markets, for example, require a very light touch because 
			one is dealing with adult parties to a transaction who do not want 
			or expect the Government to interfere very much. At the other end, 
			there is a much greater degree of interference; that is why I was 
			attracted to the suggestion of a reserve power. I should like there 
			to be powers that are potentially draconian but exercised with the 
			discretion and judgment of Solomon, although I know that is not 
			always an easy balance to strike. More needs to be done for the 
			consumer and for the little person, not for the big institutions, 
			which already have too many other cards stacked in their favour.
