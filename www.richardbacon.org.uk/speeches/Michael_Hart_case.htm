I am pleased to have the opportunity to open this debate, and I am grateful to 
the Financial Secretary for joining me in a debate about a financial fraud that 
discloses some glaring inadequacies in financial regulation and that leaves 
investors and anyone who writes a cheque worryingly exposed. I have attended a 
number of Adjournment debates recently in which the Minister's winding-up speech 
has had a slightly depressing ring to it. I do not accuse the Financial 
Secretary in that regard, but I am looking for a serious reply on a very serious 
issue that affects many people who have had money stolen and raises wide public 
policy implications. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_442 -->
The fraud came to light about two years ago, when an independent financial 
adviser, <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Michael</span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>, delayed 
returning funds due to one of his investors on a maturing investment, so much so 
that the investor, a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constituent of mine, raised the matter with <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>'s employers, Lucas Fettes, 
who called in the police. I have five constituents who have been victims of this 
theft and have had money stolen from them in amounts ranging from £10,000&nbsp;to 
£90,000. This was part of a widespread fraud involving a total of 22&nbsp;investors 
over 12&nbsp;years, mostly in East Anglia. My hon. Friends the Members for Cities of 
London and Westminster (Mr. Field) and for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) also have 
constituents who were affected and they send their apologies that they cannot be 
here this evening. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_443 -->
In total, <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Michael</span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> stole some 
£1.7&nbsp;million, most of which he has spent. Last November, he pleaded guilty to 
14&nbsp;specimen charges and was convicted of theft and other offences, and he is now 
serving a six-year prison sentence. The fraud was a simple one that has 
astonished all who have heard about it. In recent years, the fraud mainly 
involved Abbey National, because as it turned out, it was the most lax and the 
easiest to use to perpetrate the fraud. There are also some cases, including 
those involving my constituents, which involved the Norwich and Peterborough 
building society, and others involving the Leeds and Holbeck building society.
</p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_444 -->
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Michael</span></strong> <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>, working for a respected 
firm of financial advisers, Lucas Fettes, persuaded investors to take out Abbey 
National and other investment products such as individual savings accounts. He 
told them to write out crossed cheques payable only to the financial 
institution, for example a cheque made payable to &quot;Abbey National&quot; or to 
&quot;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society&quot;, precisely so that their money was 
safe; at least, that is what he told them. He then took the cheques to an Abbey 
branch in Norwich or to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norwich and Peterborough building society and so 
on, where he paid them into his own personal savings account in the name of
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Michael</span></strong> <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>. Even though some of the 
cheques were for up to £50,000, Abbey and other financial institutions did not 
ask the cheque signatories whether the bank had their permission to divert the 
money into <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>'s 
account; they just paid it directly to him. This happened 25&nbsp;times in the last 
two years of the fraud. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Three of the big unanswered questions to this day are as follows. Why would 
anyone who had wanted to pay money to <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">
Michael</span></strong> <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> 
make his or her cheque payable to Abbey National, to the Norwich and 
Peterborough building society or to the Leeds and Holbeck? Why would the bank 
and building societies involved assume that the victims did want to pay money to
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>? How did Abbey 
and the others know that the payment was not intended to reduce the cheque 
writer's mortgage, for example? </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_446 -->
Certainly Abbey and the building societies have no answer to those questions, 
but they have refused to compensate victims, in the case of Abbey saying to some 
that since it paid the money into a fraudster's account, the victims were not 
even technically customers of the bank. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_447 -->
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>'s Abbey pass book 
for the two years before he was caught shows that in that time alone he paid 
cheques worth some £1,030,000&nbsp;into that account. <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> laundered the money so 
fast that in all that time it earned just £60&nbsp;in interest. Despite regularly 
inspecting <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>'s pass 
book and auditing the account five times, Abbey saw nothing suspicious. To this 
day, neither my constituents nor any other victims have had their money back.
</p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_448 -->
For its part, Abbey said it was satisfied with its security arrangements and 
that it had merely followed industry practice on processing cheques. However, it 
had not followed industry practice—section 90&nbsp;of the Bills of Exchange Act 
1882&nbsp;states that cheques crossed and marked &quot;account payee&quot; cannot be paid into 
an account other than that of the named payee. At the very least, Abbey should 
have held the money in its own account until it found out the payee's 
intentions. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_449 -->
The legislation's intentions are highlighted in the Association for Payment 
Clearing Services, &quot;Definitive Guide to Cheques and the UK Clearing System&quot;, 
which states: </p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20.0pt"><!-- label=brev_55 -->&quot;if a 
cheque is crossed a/c payee only, it can only be paid into the account of the 
named payee. The crossing cannot be deleted, nor can the cheque be endorsed over 
to a third party.&quot;</p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_450 -->
That is common knowledge or, at least, people think it common knowledge. The 
irony is that APACS itself is made up entirely of the clearing banks, including 
Abbey National. When the <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> 
case came to trial, the Crown court judge, the Crown Prosecution Service and the 
police were extremely critical of Abbey National and its regulator, the 
Financial Services Authority. Indeed, the police and the CPS have written to the 
FSA about the abuses that they saw. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_451 -->
Few people believe that their cheques are vulnerable in the way in which that 
case has exposed or that banks and building societies can avoid their 
obligations. However, despite the intervention of the police, the Crown 
Prosecution Service, three Members of Parliament, the financial ombudsman 
service and the media, none of the victims has received a penny in compensation.
</p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_452 -->
Direct appeals to Abbey and to the other institutions have fallen on deaf ears, 
and the financial ombudsman service has been ruminating on the case for more 
than six months, held back from issuing a ruling by delaying tactics from the 
financial institutions. Money that could have been spent compensating victims 
has been invested in a QC to help defend the institutions' position. Even direct 
appeals by Abbey victims to Lord Burns, the chairman, and by some of the other 
victims to the chief executives of the building societies involved have amounted 
to nothing. During Abbey's sale to the Spanish business Banco Santander last 
year, victims urged the new owners to set compensation aside during the due 
diligence phase, but nothing has been heard since. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_453 -->
As a result, those who lost money set up the Abbey National Victims Group to 
urge the FSA to intercede in order to alert the public to the abuses of the 
crossed cheque system, to introduce better safeguards to protect the public and 
to right the wrongs that the victims have suffered. Those points apply equally 
to the victims of the scam whose cheques were made payable to the Norwich and 
Peterborough building society and to the Leeds and Holbeck building society, and 
the group includes others in addition to Abbey National victims. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_454 -->
The FSA was established to maintain confidence in and to promote understanding 
of the financial system, to secure the appropriate degree of protection for 
consumers and to reduce the extent to which it is possible for a business 
carried on by a regulated person to be used for a purpose connected with 
financial crime. Since the fraud came to light more than a year ago; it is five 
months since <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> was 
convicted; the FSA has done nothing; the public remain unaware of the dangers 
that they face; the banking regulations have not been changed; the victims have 
not been compensated; and the FSA has issued no directions. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_455 -->
However, this is the same FSA which, less than six months before the <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> fraud came to light, 
fined the same Abbey National £2.3&nbsp;million for money laundering offences. In a 
press release on 10&nbsp;December 2003, which is still on the FSA website, the FSA 
fined Abbey National companies £2,320,000. The FSA director of enforcement, 
Andrew Procter, stated: </p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><!-- label=brev_56 -->&quot;The 
failure by Abbey National to monitor compliance with FSA Money Laundering Rules 
demonstrated a marked lack of regard for its regulatory obligations. Abbey 
National failed to ensure that suspicious activity reports were promptly 
considered and reported to the National Criminal Intelligence Service and to 
identify customers adequately. Both these controls are fundamental to the UK's 
Anti-Money Laundering regime's effectiveness. Their failings also reflected the 
fact that the overall control environment, particularly compliance monitoring, 
has been weak across the group over a prolonged period.&quot;</p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_456 -->
That is a fairly damning indictment. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_457 -->
In fairness, the FSA expressed confidence that Abbey would fall into line, but 
it is quite clear that the bank did not do so, because the <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> money laundering offences 
were committed during the FSA's investigation and for months afterwards. <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> was not stopped by the 
FSA's or Abbey's new checks and controls, but by one of my constituents who had 
suspicions about a maturing investment that he believed he had purchased through 
one of the other institutions, the Norwich and Peterborough, and raised his 
concerns with <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Michael</span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>'s employer. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_458 -->
The FSA was partly responsible for that fraud being able to continue for so 
long. Its duties include authorising people to be fit and proper financial 
advisers. It is the only financial authority with access to criminal records to 
confirm an adviser's suitability and failed to spot that <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> had a criminal record for 
theft, or to pass that on to his employers. Yes, that is right: <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Michael</span></strong> <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> already had a criminal 
conviction. About 20&nbsp;years ago, he was convicted of stealing money from his 
employer, an insurance broker, and was given a two-year suspended sentence. 
After that, he continued to work in the financial services industry, with jobs 
at Norwich Union, Clerical Medical, CE Heath &amp; Co., an insurance broker, and 
Lucas Fettes, an independent financial adviser. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_459 -->
Last December, disgusted by eight months of inactivity on the FSA's part, the 
victims group lodged a formal complaint with its chief executive John Tiner. 
Nearly four months on, the FSA has not even begun its investigation. Its excuse 
is that it is unable to investigate a complaint while its own inquiries are 
continuing. A whole year to investigate the background to a simple fraud, to 
alert consumers and to change the regulations is excessive. The authority has 
still reached no conclusions. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_460 -->
Unfortunately, the story gets worse still. When the FSA broke the news of the 
delayed investigation into the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complaint, it revealed that it would not be 
investigating failings of the crossed cheque system. Its reasoning shocked the 
victims and still shocks me today. Despite having asked the banking industry to 
set up a committee to review problems with the cheque clearing system, the FSA 
said: </p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><!-- label=brev_57 -->&quot;Cheque 
payments are not in themselves a regulated activity in the UK. Therefore this 
aspect of the matter is not a direct responsibility of the FSA. The standards 
for cheque payment activities are in the main set by APACS.&quot;</p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_461 -->
APACS, as I have already outlined, is made up exclusively of the clearing banks 
themselves, so we have a case of the banks policing themselves and failing the 
consumer. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_462 -->
If the FSA has no responsibilities, what about the Treasury? As the Financial 
Secretary knows, he wrote to me on 25&nbsp;January, stating that </p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><!-- label=brev_58 -->&quot;the 
Government is aware of current concerns relating to cheque fraud&quot;.</p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_463 -->
However, he went on to say: </p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><!-- label=brev_59 -->&quot;Under the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000&nbsp;the FSA is operationally independent of 
the Government but subject to a number of accountability mechanisms&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
Accordingly, if your constituents are unhappy about the way the FSA has carried 
out its functions in relation to the matter, they might wish to use the FSA's 
complaints scheme.&quot;</p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_464 -->
We find ourselves in a situation where the victims, the FSA and the Treasury all 
recognise that there is a crisis in the cheque clearing system and that it is 
failing consumers, but no arm of the Government has the ownership or authority 
to resolve the problem; instead, it is left in the hands of the banks that 
created it. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_465 -->
That is a serious failing at the heart of Government and, because of it, 
consumers are blissfully unaware that the crossed cheque system can leave their 
money exposed, that no arm of Government is able to warn or protect them and 
that they, like my constituents and those of other Members, can go 
unrecompensed. Throughout the UK, people writing crossed cheques across the UK 
remain at risk because their banks can still pay the money into someone else's 
account and refuse to compensate them. The FSA has refused point-blank to 
investigate its failure to regulate the cheque handling system, referring 
victims to a body made up exclusively of the banks themselves, including of 
course Abbey. The Government and the FSA have failed to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warn the public or to 
change the system. The Government, the FSA and the institutions involved—Abbey, 
the Norwich and Peterborough, and the Leeds and Holbeck—have stonewalled both 
victims and MPs, and refused to compensate victims or be part of a compensation 
package involving Lucas Fettes and <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">
Hart</span></strong>'s sequestered assets. The CPS complaints to the FSA about 
Abbey's behaviour seem to be ignored. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;financial institutions are using 
delaying tactics with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the financial services ombudsman, and the FSA is 
refusing to investigate complaints into its own behaviour until it eventually 
gets round to taking a decision on Abbey. </p>

Everyone seems to think that it is someone else's responsibility. The Department 
of Trade and Industry says it is the Treasury's. I have a letter from the office 
of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry saying that it is a matter for 
the Treasury and referring my letter to the Chancellor's office. The Treasury 
says that it is really a matter for the FSA. Meanwhile, the FSA says that it is 
really down to APACS, which is responsible for cheque clearing. The FSA says 
that it has &quot;initiated discussions&quot; with the main trade associations on the 
banking side </p>
<p class="speechquote" style="margin-left:20pt"><!-- label=brev_60 -->&quot;in the 
context of seeing if banks might be able to take more measures to guard against 
fraud&quot;.</p>

That is simply inadequate. </p>

The FSA has a statutory duty to safeguard consumers and to act in their best 
interests. It has an obligation to ensure consumers are compensated where 
financial institutions have acted negligently. It has the lead role in policing 
the banking and investment sectors and in setting standards, rules and codes to 
protect consumers, to eliminate fraud and to prevent money laundering. In the 
case of <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Michael</span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong>, it has failed in 
each of those areas. People have lost £1.7&nbsp;million, and as a direct result of 
FSA inertia, people still do not have their money back. </p>
<p class="speechbody"><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Mr. <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Richard</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT> <FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG><FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Bacon</STRONG></FONT></STRONG></FONT>"--><!-- label=stpa_469 -->
The FSA has failed to identify the most basic and fundamental weaknesses in the 
crossed cheque system. It has failed to protect consumers when the flaws were 
drawn to its attention by victims, so that nearly two years after the danger was 
exposed and five months after <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> 
was convicted, customers are still exposed. It has failed to draw wider consumer 
attention to the weaknesses, thereby allowing consumers generally to be put at 
risk for longer. It failed to identify that <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Michael</span></strong> <strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal">Hart</span></strong> had a criminal record for 
dishonesty and was simply not a fit and proper person to be an FSA-authorised 
independent financial adviser. </p>

The FSA has failed to put pressure on the banks and building societies, and the 
best that it can come up with is the wholly inadequate response that it has 
initiated discussions. Rather than issuing a direction or holding the most 
urgent review with the Government, it has merely set up a committee inviting the 
industry to propose a solution. It has failed to put pressure on banks and 
building societies to compensate victims or to remind financial institutions of 
their duty of care obligations to customers. It has failed to monitor Abbey's 
security failings, even though it had clear early warning of them and had fined 
Abbey £2.3&nbsp;million for having slack regime: a rum world this, where the bank 
gets fined because it has opened itself to the risk of money laundering, but 
when it actually occurs, nothing happens. </p>

The FSA has failed to communicate effectively or in a timely manner with Members 
of Parliament or victims, even taking three months to respond to one MP. That 
farce cannot continue. I urge the Financial Secretary to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do four things: 
first, to commit the Treasury to undertake a full and fundamental review of the 
failings of the system; secondly, to recommend changes; thirdly, to publish the 
findings; and, fourthly, to intercede in this case and tell the FSA to bring its 
review to a very speedy conclusion and to give the highest priority to 
compensating the victims of what is plainly a dangerous systemic failure. <!-- label=time_38 -->
