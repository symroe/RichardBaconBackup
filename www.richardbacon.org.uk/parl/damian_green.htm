  <p class="updatebody2"><font style="font-size: 10pt; text-decoration:underline">SPEAKER MUST NOW RESIGN</font></p>
  <p class="updatebody2"> I no longer believe the Speaker can stay in his job. It 
    was a lamentable and shocking performance. He has failed 
    in his fundamental duty to protect Parliament and to 
    protect MPs from unlawful search and seizure. <br />
                    <br />
    The rights of MPs only exist so that we can use them to 
    defend the interests of our constituents. In fact they 
    are our constituents' rights which we use on their 
    behalf to protect them.</p>
  <span class="updatebody2"> But I have no confidence in the Speaker's willingness 
	or ability to defend Parliament or me as an MP so that I can defend the 
	interests of my constituents. He has to go. It is that simple. <br>
    <br>
His attempt to blame the Serjeant-at-Arms was distasteful, to put it mildly. 
	She cannot answer back. He is responsible and that means he has to take 
	responsibility. He cannot blame others and he must resign.</span>
  <p class="newsbody">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="updatebody">UPDATE : 6pm Tuesday 2 December</p>
<p class="updatebody">This afternoon I met with the Serjeant-of-Arms, Jill 
    Pay, and separately with the Private Secretary to the Speaker, Angus 
    Sinclair. I explained: <br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="updatebody">my grave concerns about the 
      arrest of Damian Green MP and that the raid by the 
      police should not have been allowed; 
    </li><br>
    <li class="updatebody">that at the moment I have no 
      confidence that the Speaker is willing or able to defend 
      my right as an MP to hold information without the fear 
      of being raided by the police; </li><br>
    <li class="updatebody">that I find this unacceptable, 
      since I have received information from civil servants in 
      the past and may do so again in the future, and that I 
      could not tolerate police officers snooping around my 
      office when I am seeking to do my job in the public 
      interest; </li><br>
    <li class="updatebody">and that if the Speaker cannot or 
      will not uphold the Authority of his Office and defend the rights of MPs 
      then there is no point in his carrying on as Speaker.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="updatebody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>Jill Pay said that she was unable to say anything and made 
    no comment.&nbsp; Mr Sinclair said that the Speaker was 
    necessarily mute until Parliament meets because the first 
    words he says on this subject will be in his statement to 
    the House of Commons on Wednesday, which is perfectly fair.&nbsp; 
    I look forward to hearing the Speaker&#8217;s statement.&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000" size="2"><i> Original statement below:</i></font></b></span></p>
  <p class="bigword9" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">THE ARREST OF DAMIAN GREEN MP</p>
  <p class="newsbody">
Richard Bacon says:
<p class="newsbody" style="MARGIN-left:0pt"> <b>The arrest of Damian Green is a catastrophe which affects every MP.&nbsp; It 
  also raises exceptionally serious questions about the behaviour of the police, 
  the actions of both ministers and senior civil servants in the Home Office and 
  the conduct of the Speaker of the House of Commons.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="MARGIN-left:0pt"> <b>The right to oppose the government of the day is vastly more important than 
  which political party happens to hold office. It is the cardinal fact which 
  defines us as a free country.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> If Damian Green were suspected of murdering someone, there would be no 
  objection to gathering evidence where ever necessary.&nbsp; But this is 
  not the case.&nbsp; He is an effective Opposition politician who has 
  exposed facts which the government of the day finds embarrassing and 
  which the public has a right to know.&nbsp; Ministers say they were kept 
  in the dark about Green&#8217;s arrest.&nbsp; This is barely credible but if 
  it is true then what were civil servants up to?&nbsp; Sir David 
  Normington, the permanent under-secretary at the Home Office, is in the 
  firing line because he should not have triggered the police 
  investigation.&nbsp; And the police &#8211; in the person of Sir Paul 
  Stephenson, the acting head of the Met Police &#8211; should have refused 
  Normington&#8217;s request, telling him that leaks of unclassified documents 
  were not a matter for the police.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> Neither seems to have understood that we don&#8217;t do political arrests in 
  this country and that the legitimate job of the Opposition &#8211; paid for by 
  taxpayers &#8211; is to annoy the government and hold it to account.&nbsp; The 
  fact that civil servants thought ministers being annoyed was a reason to 
  call in the police is bad enough.&nbsp; The fact that the <i>police</i> should think that ministers and senior civil servants being annoyed was 
  enough to warrant police action is truly alarming.&nbsp; Stephenson has 
  shown that he lacks sound judgement.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> What is worst of all &#8211; profoundly shocking &#8211; is that the police should 
  search an MP&#8217;s office looking for material given to that MP by civil 
  servants.&nbsp; In common with other MPs, I have been sent material by 
  civil servants which it was in the public interest for everyone to know 
  about.&nbsp; As a member of the public accounts committee, I was sent a 
  dossier in 2006 by a civil servant who was distressed that foreign 
  workers were abusing the tax credit system to buy homes abroad.&nbsp; 
  The insider sent me documentary evidence that immigrants from eastern 
  Europe were coming to the UK, taking low-paid jobs and then applying for 
  tax credits.&nbsp; Once the claim had been set up, the fraudsters were 
  returning to their home country but the tax credit payments continued to 
  be paid into their bank accounts.&nbsp; They then used the money to buy 
  property in eastern Europe. Meanwhile, the experienced anti-fraud teams 
  in HM Revenue and Customs who could have helped the situation were being 
  made redundant to meet government efficiency targets.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> I passed on the material to the National Audit Office for investigation 
  but I would not have tolerated the police snooping around my office 
  looking for it, which would have exposed the civil servant in question.&nbsp; 
  It is paramount that MPs can hold information without fearing a knock on 
  the door from the police. </b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> What is truly surprising in this episode is that the Speaker of the 
  House of Commons allowed the search of an MP&#8217;s office to take place.&nbsp; 
  I cannot accept that this was the correct decision.&nbsp; It leaves me 
  wondering how I can have any confidence that the Speaker would defend my 
  right as a Member of Parliament to hold sensitive information without 
  the fear of a police raid.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> If the Speaker knew about the proposed raid and gave clearance for it, 
  he made a dreadful mistake.&nbsp; If he didn&#8217;t know about the raid until 
  it was too late to stop it, then he still failed to defend the rights of 
  MPs.&nbsp; I have a sinking feeling that the Speaker has let us down in 
  something of incalculable importance and that it is now hard to see what 
  he is there for.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> We have to know how this happened: exactly <i>who</i> gave permission 
  for the raid on Damian Green&#8217;s office at Westminster?&nbsp; The police 
  would not have taken this action without permission. </b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> The only certain fact is that the raid occurred.&nbsp; It seems unlikely 
  that the granting of permission for a police raid would have been the 
  unaided decision of the Serjeant-at-Arms, Jill Pay.&nbsp; She is a 
  servant of the Speaker and would not have had authority to give 
  permission without consulting either the Speaker or the Clerk of the 
  House.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> The position of the Clerk of the House, Malcolm Jack, is central. Either 
  the Clerk of the House <i>was</i> consulted and he advised that the raid 
  should be permitted; or he was consulted and he advised that it was <i> not</i> permissible but he was ignored; or he was not consulted.&nbsp; If he was 
  not consulted this would beg two questions: Why not? And why hasn&#8217;t he 
  said so? </b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> The basic premise must be that the Clerk of the House would have been 
  consulted by the Speaker.&nbsp; If this is the case, then either the 
  Speaker went against the advice of the Clerk of the House, which is 
  difficult to believe, or the Clerk of the House advised that the raid 
  was permissible.&nbsp; The logic of the position is that the Clerk of 
  the House was consulted and advised that the raid was acceptable.&nbsp; 
  And it wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; So his position may be in doubt.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> The Leader of the House of Commons, Harriet Harman, appears to 
  understand the magnitude of what has happened.&nbsp; Senior Labour Party 
  figures such as David Blunkett and others have also expressed their 
  disquiet.&nbsp; Our political system can only operate if there is 
  agreement between the parties on certain fundamentals.&nbsp; One of 
  these is that those in government do not use the resources of the State 
  to harry and intimidate their opponents.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> The Sessional Orders which the Speaker will read out on Wednesday at the 
  State Opening of Parliament refer to the &#8220;undoubted rights and 
  privileges&#8221; of MPs. This means something.&nbsp; It is of course true 
  that so long as the government commands a majority in the Commons it 
  should get its business after due debate.&nbsp; But on Wednesday, before 
  we debate the Queen&#8217;s Speech &#8211; which is after all just one legislative 
  programme of one particular government &#8211; we will need to debate 
  something of much more fundamental and lasting importance, which is the 
  rights of MPs and Parliament in our State.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> We are not a free people by accident.&nbsp; It is the result of choices 
  and hard work and lives given in sacrifice.&nbsp; This whole business 
  makes me suspect that the ruling elite are losing respect for those in 
  whose interest they are meant to be functioning.</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> &nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class="newsbody"><b> A parliamentary colleague has been arrested for doing his job.&nbsp; 
  Making this right and protecting our Parliament transcend everything 
  else. There may be the need for a string of resignations.&nbsp; It is 
  imperative that these events do not set a precedent but rather that they 
  define the point at which those responsible finally understand that they 
  have gone too far and that they must pay the price for having done so. </b></p>
