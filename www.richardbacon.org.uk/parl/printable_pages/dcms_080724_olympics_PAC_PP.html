		Village, 
		says MP</span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has said that attempts by Australian firm Lend Lease to raise its share of the investment into the 2012 London Games&#8217; Olympic Village have been hit by the global credit squeeze. 
  
  
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>Mr Bacon said today: </b><b>&#8220;The Credit Crunch is putting the squeeze 
                  on London&#8217;s Olympic Village.&nbsp; Banks are now extremely reluctant to sink money 
                  into land or property deals, and the company contracted to build the 
                  Olympic Village, Lend Lease, is struggling to raise enough capital.</b>
<p class="newsbody"><b><span class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"><b>&#8220;</b></span>Lend Lease have made it clear that raising the 
                  money is ultimately the government&#8217;s problem and it is now highly likely 
                  that taxpayers will have to bail out the project&#8221;.</b></p>
                <p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon added: </b><b>&#8220;The Department for Culture, Media and Sport 
                  wants British athletes to come at least fourth and second in the 2012 
                  Olympic and Paralympic Games respectively.&nbsp; The Department aims to raise 
                  &pound;100 million from the private sector to help British athletes win medals 
                in 2012.&nbsp; </b></p>
                <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;However, the Department has nothing to offer 
                  would-be donors and has no fundraising experience.&nbsp; There are no 
                  guarantees that the private sector is prepared to cough up &pound;100 million, 
                  especially at a time of economic uncertainty.&nbsp; </b></p>
                <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Instead, the Department seems to have a 
                  Micawberish belief that &#8216;something will turn up&#8217;.&nbsp; It needs to be 
                  crystal clear about how it is going to find this money&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
                <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts 
                  select committee published two reports into the preparations for the 
                  2012 London Olympic and Paralympic games.&nbsp; 
                  The report into the delivery of the 2012 London Games finds that the 
                  global credit squeeze has particularly affected the ability of 
                  Australian firm Lend Lease to raise its &pound;450 million share of the 
                  Olympic Village investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="newsbody">In June 2008, a report on 
                  Olympic preparedness for the Mayor of London said that the Olympic 
                  Delivery Authority (ODA) is exploring other options for the financing of 
                  the Olympic Village, but that all scenarios for the successful 
                  completion of the project are likely to require significant additional 
                  funds from the taxpayer. </p>
                <p class="newsbody">On 21 June 2008, a Lend Lease spokeswoman told the 
                  Times newspaper that: &#8220;Getting funding is essentially the ODA&#8217;s problem. 
                  If all the parameters can&#8217;t be met, we won't do it as a developer&#8221;.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="newsbody">The committee&#8217;s separate report into the 
                  preparations for sporting success in 2012 finds that the Department for 
                  Culture, Media and Sport and UK Sport have set goals for the Great 
                  Britain teams to finish fourth and second in the 2012 Olympic and 
                  Paralympic medal tables respectively. &nbsp;To support these goals, the 
                  Department is required to raise &pound;100 million from the private sector and 
                  plans to start its fundraising after the Beijing 2008 Games.&nbsp; The 
                  Department is optimistic that it can attract private sector donors and 
                  confident it can raise the &pound;100 million.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="newsbody">However, the report finds that the Department for 
                  Culture, Media and Sport has no experience of raising such funding, 
                  could not say what it had to offer potential donors and could not 
                  guarantee that the private sector would be willing to contribute as much 
                  as &pound;100 million in funding.</p>
