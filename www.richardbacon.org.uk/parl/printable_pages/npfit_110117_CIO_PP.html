		<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has written to the Senior Civil Servant in charge of the  National Programme for IT in the NHS, asking further detailed questions over the value for money that is being provided by the scheme. </p>
		    <p class="newsbody">In a <a class="tsb" href="#dearmsc">letter</a> to Ms Christine Connelly, Chief Information Officer for the Department of Health, Mr Bacon expressed concern over the value for money provided by BT's &pound;546 million contract for the South of England and  called into question whether, given the proposed reductions in the functionality and  the number of software packages being deployed under the  contract,  Ms Connelly could still be confident that value for money was being provided. </p>
		    <p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon  said: &ldquo;While  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to seek additional savings from the  National Programme for IT,  I am very concerned that these reductions are being achieved by permitting BT and CSC to  make disproportionate cuts to the number and functionality of the systems being offered. </p>
		    <p class="newsbold"> &ldquo;I am keen to explore whether value for money is truly being delivered for the NHS and for taxpayers. I have posed Ms Connelly a number of questions and I very much look forward to receiving her response&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="newsbody">The detail of the contract between BT and the Department of Health for the National Programme in the South of England was laid out in a letter to Mr Bacon from the Comptroller and Auditor General and Head of the National Audit Office, Amyas Morse. </p>
		    <p class="newsbody">In a previous letter, Mr Bacon also asked Ms Connelly to explain the financial exposure of  the Department of Health and the NHS if it should turn out that hospitals do  not take Lorenzo because it is not adequate for their needs. </p>

                <p class="edirots">13  January 2011</p>
                <p class="edirots">Dear  Ms Connelly<a name="dearmsc"></a></p>
                <p align="left" class="edirots"><strong>Contract Renegotiations in the  National Programme for IT in the NHS</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">I  am writing following your appearance at the Public Accounts Committee and our  subsequent exchange of correspondence because of my continued concerns about  the renegotiations of contracts with BT and CSC in relation to the National  Programme for IT.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">While  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to seek additional savings from the  National Programme for IT, and its commitment to permit Trusts more autonomy in  making future IT decisions, I am very concerned about the evidence now emerging  about the details of the contract negotiations, and specifically about whether  proposed spending reductions are being achieved by permitting BT and CSC to  make disproportionate cuts in planned deployments and in the functionality of  systems on offer. I note your observation in September 2010 that <em>&ldquo;the best way to deliver value is to honour the contracts&rdquo;</em>. It would seem to me therefore that we should explore whether value is in  fact being delivered for the NHS and for taxpayers. I would therefore be  grateful if you could confirm or comment on the following observations:</p>
                <ol>
                 <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">In  London, the new contract signed with BT in April cuts  &pound;112m from the original &pound;1.1 billion contract signed in 2003. Of the 32 acute  trusts in London, around half will not now get Cerner Millennium as BT will offer  at most 10 more Cerner deployments to add to the 8 already in place; fewer  community trusts will get RiO; and the requirement for BT to deliver around  1,500 new GP systems across the capital has been dropped. New software for the  London Ambulance Service has also been abandoned. This would seem to amount to  delivering half the original contract for a small reduction in charges.&nbsp;  In your opinion, is this really delivering value?<span class="edirots"><br>
                 <br>
                 </span>                </li>
                  <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">I  note that Imperial College, contracted to implement Cerner Millennium, recently  announced that a rival product has gone live across the entire Trust.&nbsp;  Will the NHS pay for the Cerner Millennium deployment at Imperial even if it is  not taken up?&nbsp; In the circumstances, can you say with any confidence that  BT&rsquo;s other commitments in London will in fact be taken up?</li>
                  <span class="edirots"><br>
                  </span>
                 <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">As  the functionality of Cerner Millennium has&nbsp;been cut back drastically and,  as its name implies, the product is now out of date technically, can you say  whether you consider it is still value for money?&nbsp; I would point out that,  under the original plan, the products now being installed should have been  running live for six years.<br>
                   <br>
                </li>
                 <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">In his letter to me of  18th November 2010, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated that  BT will be paid &pound;36m for each of the seven NHS trusts running Cerner Millennium  already installed by the Southern region&rsquo;s former local service provider,  Fujitsu. It will get &pound;23m for each of three new Cerner installations. And it  will receive &pound;9m for each of the 25 RiO community and mental health sites in the  South. All prices are said to be based on pricing in the other LSP contracts.  However, it has been reported that RIO has been implemented in other Trusts for  between &pound;0.5 and &pound;1 million. Is this correct? If so, what questions does this  raise in relation to value for money? Is it also correct that BT will be paid  more for delivering Cerner to three &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; sites than it would have been  paid for the four sites originally agreed?&nbsp; The Cerner prices seem to be  much higher than the prices paid by Trusts such as the Wirral who purchased  directly. How can this difference in price be justified?<br>
                  <br>
                  </li>
                  <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">In  the case of CSC and its software contractor iSoft, it would also appear that  the companies may secure guarantees of substantial payments even if in practice  NHS Trusts choose alternative products, so that there are many fewer  deployments than planned.                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">I understand that the  DH is negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding with CSC&nbsp;that would see  187 NHS trusts assumed to take the Lorenzo system; only 35 fewer than specified  in the original &pound;3 billion contract. But would you not agree that there is good  reason to think that many fewer Trusts will in practice agree to take the  system? In March, Trusts across the North, Midlands and East of England were  advised that the version of Lorenzo offered for deployment would have greatly  reduced functionality. A number of Trusts have already indicated that they are  not committed to Lorenzo and reserve the right to make other arrangements. I  note that in October 2010, you stated that: <em>&ldquo;those who don&rsquo;t [take Lorenzo]  can do what they want and they won&rsquo;t get penalised, however if we do not get  enough trusts in totality to meet the contract then the NHS as a whole will be  penalised.&rdquo;</em> Does this represent good value for money?<br>
                    <br>
                 </li>
                  <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">As you know, the  Lorenzo system has repeatedly missed announced deadlines since the 2005 iSoft  Annual Report, which stated that it was &ldquo;available from early 2004&quot;. Most recently, in  April 2009, you set a deadline of March 2010 for Lorenzo, stating: <em>&quot;If  we don't see significant progress ... then we will move to a new plan for  delivering infomatics in healthcare&quot;.</em> Yet again, this deadline was  missed. </li>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">Even in the small  number of cases where the current version of Lorenzo (much reduced from its  original planned functionality) has been deployed, for example at University  Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, there have been serious problems. The  Trust failed to go-live with Lorenzo in March 2010, finally went live in the  summer, and has been subsequently working on a &lsquo;stabilisation plan&rsquo;. By  December 2010, there were believed to be hundreds of remaining bugs in the  system. I also understand that NHS Bury has yet to sign off the deployment  verification for the implementation of Lorenzo Release 1.9 - a year after going  live with the system. </li>
                <br>
                <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">Does committing the  NHS in this way to payment for systems that may not be delivered represent good  value, given the repeated failure of iSoft to deliver a working product to  deadline? In these circumstances, why is the NHS still contractually bound to  minimum volumes?<br>
                  <br>
                  </li>
                  <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">I am also concerned  that it appears that possible providers for &pound;100 million community and child  health systems at 13 Trusts in the South of England, under the Additional  Supply Capability and Capacity (ASCC) framework, have been deterred from  bidding because of what they have called &ldquo;onerous&rdquo; requirements and &ldquo;untenable  terms and conditions&rdquo;, which bias the process in favour of existing lead  suppliers under the NPfIT. Is it correct that suppliers able to deploy systems  at a fraction of the cost of the LSP solutions have not been given a fair  opportunity to compete? </li>
                  <br>
                <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">I would also  appreciate any observations you have on how the costs of the iSoft Lorenzo, Rio and  Cerner Millennium systems compare with the indicative costs submitted by  suppliers as part of the ASCC market testing for acute and community systems  (taking into account, of course, the costs of the various key milestone  payments). As you know, the National Audit Office is now beginning a further  urgent inquiry into developments in the NPfIT, and in particular of the  awarding of former Fujitsu sites to BT. I would suggest that this inquiry will  review a great deal of evidence that is relevant to the question of whether  proposed contract renegotiations with BT and CSC really do represent good value  to the NHS and taxpayers. I would therefore ask for your undertaking that no  further steps will be taken to conclude further agreements with either company  until the NAO has reported and the Public Accounts Committee has had time to  consider its findings. It would seem to me that to enter into new irrevocable  commitments in advance of this report would be irresponsible and potentially a  breach of the Accounting officer&rsquo;s responsibilities.<br>
                  <br>
                  </li>
                  <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">I  would also ask you to undertake a specific review of the costs of running the  Cerner Millennium system over a traditional PAS in Taunton; and the costs of  running Lorenzo over a normal PAS in Morecambe Bay.</li>
                  <br>
                 <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">Please  could you send me copies of any value for money reports which compare the cost  and value of NPfIT systems over traditional deployments. Please include N3  Broadband and PACS as well as acute, mental health and community systems.&nbsp; </li>
                  <br>
                  <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">Please  could you supply a copy of the&nbsp;indicative pricing submitted for ASCC &ndash; for  acute and community trusts.</li>
                  <br>
                 <li style="text-align:justify" class="edirots">Please  could you supply a more detailed breakdown of the 7 southern sites, in  particular: the Fujitsu cost of each deployment; the Fujitsu cost of the  interim running between the two contracts; the cost of the transfer, the  running costs till the end of the contract; and the anticipated annual running  costs payable by Trusts after the contract ends.<br>
                 </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="edirots">I  look forward very much to receiving your reply.</p>
