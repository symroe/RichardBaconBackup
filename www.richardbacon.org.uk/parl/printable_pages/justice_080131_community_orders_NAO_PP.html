    <p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Community order waiting list &#8216;absurd', says MP</p>
    <p class="newsbody"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has said that the probation Service is &#8216;all over the place&#8217; on community orders, as a new report finds some offenders have to go on a waiting list to complete their orders. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The Probation Service is all over the place on 
      community orders. It does not know how many community orders it can 
      deliver, how much they will cost or how many orders are being completed 
      nationally. What&#8217;s more, the idea that criminals are being put on a 
      waiting list for punishment is absurd&#8221;. <br>
          <br>
  &#8220;If we must have community orders, then the Probation Service must 
      manage them properly. Community orders should only be used if they can 
      be shown as the most effective means of delivering justice, not because 
      they ease prison overcrowding&#8221;. </b><br>
          <br>
      Mr Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, was speaking as the National Audit 
      Office published its report on the supervision of community orders in 
      England and Wales. Community orders allow judges to tailor community 
      sentences to the severity of the crime and, at the same time, address 
      the offending behaviour. The National Probation Service supervises all 
      offenders who receive a community order, but the report finds that the 
      Service does not know with any certainty how many community orders it 
      can deliver within its resources, nor has it determined the full cost of 
      delivering community orders. In addition, no national data on 
      non-completions is available. <br>
          <br>
      There are long waiting lists for some order requirements. This may mean 
      the offender cannot complete the requirement before the end of the 
      order. Certain programmes, such as the Integrated Domestic Abuse 
      programme, are particularly lengthy and difficult to complete within the 
      timeframe of some orders.</p>
