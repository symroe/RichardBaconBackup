<br>
<p class="newsbody">COMMENTING ON the publication of the Commons public accounts  committee&rsquo;s report into how the Ministry of Defence manages the delivery of  equipment to military operations, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of  the committee, said:</p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;The MoD has been  pledging action to drag its supply chain into the modern era since the Cold  War, yet it still needs a drastic overhaul.&nbsp;  The MoD&rsquo;s accounts have not been given a clean bill of health for three  consecutive years, in no small part because the MoD hasn&rsquo;t been recording  whether supplies are in warehouses or at the front line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;No-one disputes that  the MoD&rsquo;s principal duty is to focus on operations, but this doesn&rsquo;t absolve  the Ministry from treating taxpayers&rsquo; money with care. &nbsp;It is also a bit rich of the MoD&rsquo;s top brass  to dismiss the potential for savings, given that they have done almost nothing  to find out how much money an efficient supply chain could save and also that  they don&rsquo;t routinely examine how the United States and France run their  military supply chains to see what may be learned. </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;The willingness of  the newly-appointed Bernard Gray to take responsibility for failures is  refreshing, but he has much to do if the military supply chain is to be made  fit for purpose.&nbsp; I hope we will see the  fruits of his labours before too long&rdquo;.</strong></p>
