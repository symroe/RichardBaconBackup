  <span class="directory"><em>Richard Bacon MP on the NHS IT Programme</em></span></strong></p>
<hr size="1" id="line" width="50%">
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform:uppercase">South  Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon (Conservative) has said that the troubled &pound;11.4  billion NHS IT Programme should be scrapped to protect taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr  Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking after a  highly critical report was published by the  National Audit Office (NAO), which concluded that the central aim of the NHS&rsquo;s  flagship IT programme, to create a detailed electronic care record for every  NHS patient in England, will not be achieved. </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>Mr  Bacon, who triggered the NAO inquiry, said:&nbsp; &ldquo;This report could not be  clearer. The National Programme for IT in the NHS will not deliver its central  aim of a detailed electronic care record for every patient in England.&nbsp;  This was the <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em> for the Programme  and the main justification for its extremely high price.&nbsp; However, the NAO  is clear that the &pound;2.7 billion already spent on care records systems is not  value for money. </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;It is perfectly clear that throwing more money at the problem  will not work. This turkey will never fly and it is time the Department of  Health faced reality and channelled the remaining funds into something useful  that will actually benefit patients.&nbsp; The largest civilian I.T. project in  the world has failed.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;This has been a sorry saga.&nbsp; Many hospitals have been put  under pressure to buy immature and incomplete software systems that they never  wanted in the first place, simply  to spare the blushes of Connecting for Health, which has become increasingly  reliant on sophistry to give the impression that the Programme remains on  track.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;If  the National Programme for I.T. in the NHS had been created by one of this  country's enemies in order to waste as much UK taxpayers&rsquo; money as possible  whilst infuriating doctors, nurses and hospital managers, then it could hardly  have done a better job.&nbsp; The sad truth is that, far from accelerating the  pace of technological change in the NHS, this project has actually held it  back&rdquo;. </strong></p>

<p class="newsbold">Q: What is the background to Richard Bacon&rsquo;s question last week to David  Cameron about Lorenzo and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) ?</p>
<p class="newsbody">A:  This article from ComputerWorldUK provides background which you may find useful: http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/the-tony-collins-blog/2011/05/pms-welcome-intervention-on-the-npfit/index.htm </p>
<hr id="line" size="1" width="50%">
<strong>Q: What is Lorenzo?</strong>
<p class="newsbody">A: Lorenzo  is supposedly a full service software system for running an acute hospital,  supplied by a company called iSoft. CSC is one of the main &lsquo;Local Service  Providers&rsquo; in the NHS IT Programme and is contracted to install iSoft&rsquo;s Lorenzo  product in NHS acute hospitals in North, Midlands and East i.e. 3/5th  of the NHS. But it can&rsquo;t do this because Lorenzo doesn&rsquo;t work, even though  iSoft told its shareholders that Lorenzo was &ldquo;available from 2004&rdquo;.&nbsp; iSoft  was a stock market darling whose share price rose sharply some years ago partly  due to the company&rsquo;s apparently exciting prospects in the NHS. The directors sold  tens of millions of pounds worth of shares before the share price crashed. Four former iSoft directors now face criminal charges for false accounting,  which they deny. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Contrary  to assurances that suppliers would only be paid for delivery, Connecting for  Health gave iSoft at least &pound;82m in advance payments to prop it up.</p>
<p class="newsbody">CSC has known there was a big problem  with Lorenzo for years. In February 2006 a joint study by Accenture and CSC  concluded there were &ldquo;no believable plans&rdquo; </a>for developing Lorenzo.  Accenture cut its losses and walked away after announcing losses of &pound;270  million from its two contracts.&nbsp; CSC then took on both Accenture&rsquo;s  contracts, tripling its involvement in the Programme, with contracts worth &pound;3.2  billion.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Despite the fact that it cannot  install Lorenzo, CSC has (unlike Accenture) never declared losses from the  Programme. Lorenzo was supposed to have been installed in every hospital in its  contract (3/5ths of the NHS) by 2006. CSC would now need to install  Lorenzo in at least 2 hospitals per month <em>every </em>month for the next 4  years. So far, it has managed a very limited deployment in 3 hospitals in the  past 7 years and even this has caused chaos.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Connecting  for Health has offered repeated excuses over many years and promised that  &lsquo;eventually&rsquo; things will turn out alright, while downscoping the project behind  the backs of hospital Trusts so that it delivers much less than the original  contract specification - which was the only  justification for the very high price.&nbsp; In 2007 the Health Committee concluded that there was now a &ldquo;perplexing  lack of clarity about exactly what NPfIT will now deliver&rdquo;, while also in 2007 the  PAC stated that &ldquo;at the present rate of progress it is unlikely that  significant clinical benefits will be delivered by the end of the contract  period&rdquo;.</p>
<hr id="line2" size="1" width="50%">
<p class="newsbold">Q: Why are things coming to the boil now?</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">A: In  total there is still between &pound;4.3 billion and &pound;5 billion unspent, but CSC has  just told its shareholders it expects to conclude a new agreement with Connecting for Health in the &ldquo;next few weeks&rdquo;. </p>
<p class="newsbody">I  have been very concerned about the apparent determination of the Department of  Health to keep CSC in the Programme no matter what, and to negotiate new  arrangements in which CSC would deliver a cut down version of Lorenzo to a much  smaller number of NHS trusts in return for only a  small reduction in price.&nbsp; I believe this is not a commercially sensible  route to take and there are signs that the Cabinet Office agrees.&nbsp; The  Department of Health already took this approach with BT in London, where the  functionality and the number of sites was halved in return for just 10%  reduction in price.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">CSC has turned missing deadlines into an art form. Nothing has  changed to make anyone believe it will be any different in future, because  Lorenzo doesn&rsquo;t work properly.&nbsp; Indeed, although the NHS chose four  &ldquo;Pathfinders&rdquo; for a major push to show that Lorenzo could be made to work, one  of them, Pennine Trust, has just dropped CSC over a &quot;lack of confidence&quot;. This is hugely significant. It  says that even with an enormous push, Lorenzo is never going to work properly.  CSC were given a clear set of targets to meet by the Department of Health,  including successful installation of the Lorenzo system at Pennine Trust by March 2011, but yet again  they failed.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Instead  of acknowledging the obvious fact that CSC can&rsquo;t cope with Lorenzo, Connecting  for Health is trying <em>yet again</em> to throw CSC a lifeline. It is now looking&nbsp;for a replacement for Pennine, despite its  previous insistence that CSC had to deliver the latest version of the Lorenzo  software to four NHS trusts by the end of March 2011 to unlock contract payment  milestones, or risk having its contract ended.&nbsp;  Instead of facing reality, the NHS is trying to find another hospital as a  guinea pig to take the failed Lorenzo.</strong></p>
<hr id="line2" size="1" width="50%">
<p class="newsbold">Q: Why would the DoH and  Connecting for Health do this?</p>
<p class="newsbody">A: Connecting for Health only really  exists because of the big Local Service Provider contracts. If CSC were fired  or walked away, it would be very difficult to find a justification for  Connecting for Health&rsquo;s continued existence.</p>
<p class="newsbody">One of the critical weaknesses in  NPfIT has always been the role of Local Service Providers such as CSC, and  their preferred software partners. Most industry experts think the Local  Service Providers were simply unnecessary and that hospital Trusts should have  been empowered and partially paid to obtain what they needed directly from  software suppliers, subject only to common standards.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Accenture walked away and Fujitsu was  fired.&nbsp; Of the remaining two LSPs, BT&rsquo;s software partner is Cerner, mainly  using the Cerner Millennium system, and CSC&rsquo;s software partner is iSoft using  the Lorenzo system. Both systems have been subject to frequent problems,  failures and delays. Lorenzo was actually reported as ready for installation in  iSoft&rsquo;s 2005 Annual Report but this was incorrect, hence the impending criminal  prosecution of four former iSoft directors.</p>
<hr id="line" size="1" width="50%">
<p class="newsbold">Q: Why not negotiate a cheaper deal?</p>
<p class="newsbody">A: This  is what the Department of Health has been trying to do, but achieving &lsquo;savings&rsquo;  of &pound;500 million by knocking the price down for CSC&rsquo;s work from &pound;3.2 billion to  &pound;2.7 billion (or whatever figure they finally reached) won&rsquo;t help because  Lorenzo is frankly uninstallable. Whatever deal were to end up being struck  would reduce the overall price at the cost of a disproportionate reduction in  what CSC would then deliver.&nbsp; I agree with the Cabinet Office that this  would not be value for money.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Anyway,  there is little hard evidence that trusts actually want Lorenzo, since it  doesn&rsquo;t work and causes chaos. The Trusts get paid by DoH just for being on a  list of potential takers. There is evidence that while many Trusts are <em>saying </em>they wanted Lorenzo they really have no intention of ever deploying it.  Some are signing contracts with their current suppliers or looking for other  solutions. Foundation Trusts cannot be compelled to take Lorenzo, but centrally  agreed volume commitments mean the NHS is in trouble if they don&rsquo;t.</strong></p>
<hr id="line" size="1" width="50%">
<p class="newsbold">Q: What should happen now?</p>
<p class="newsbody">A: The NHS IT Programme hasn&rsquo;t worked and there is no evidence that  it is going to work. So:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li class="newsbody">Rather than squander another &pound;4 billion to &pound;5 billion that is  still unspent, the NHS should recognise reality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li class="newsbody">Connecting for Health has failed to achieve its central purpose  and it should be closed down. The Local Service Provider contract with CSC  should be terminated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li class="newsbody">NHS  Trusts must be set free to choose the systems that meet the needs of patients  and medical professionals.&nbsp; They should have the  power to source products locally that suit their needs, subject only to common  standards</li>
