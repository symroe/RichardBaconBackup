	<font face="Arial">South Norfolk </font></span>MP Richard Bacon has called 
	on the Department for Work and Pensions to think more carefully when 
	designing its benefit information, after a new report has found that the 
	department's most important leaflets required a reading age higher than the 
	national average to understand.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the commons public accounts 
	committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its 
	report on the use of leaflets to communicate with benefit claimants.&nbsp; The 
	NAO tested 13 leaflets put out by the Department for Work and Pensions and 
	found that all of them required a reading age higher than the national 
	average.&nbsp; The Government currently estimates that 56 per cent of the 
	population have literacy skills that would not be sufficient to gain GCSE 
	passes of grades A, B or C.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon said today: </p>
	<p class="newsbody"><b>&quot;How government departments communicate with the 
	public is very important.&nbsp; Too often, there are complex forms, poorly 
	designed leaflets and confusing advice.&nbsp; The situation is not helped by poor 
	literacy levels amongst those who most need the help of the benefits 
	system&quot;.</b></p>
	<p class="newsbody"><b>&quot;If benefit leaflets cannot be understood by their 
	target audience, then people will not get the information they need to make 
	important choices about their lives.&nbsp; The English language is a wonderful 
	tool for communication but it must be used properly.&nbsp; I hope to see an 
	improvement in the design of government forms and leaflets soon&quot;.&nbsp; </b></p>
