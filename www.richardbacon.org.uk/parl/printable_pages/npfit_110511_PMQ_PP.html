<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Bacon welcomes PM's pledge on NHS computer project</p>

<p class="newsbody"> SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has welcomed an assurance from Prime Minister David Cameron that the Government is determined to get better value for money from the controversial National Programme for IT in the NHS. </p>
<p class="newsbody">In particular, Mr Bacon welcomed the Prime Minister's insistence that the Government would sign no further contracts with computer firm CSC, whose troubled Lorenzo software  system is at the heart of many of the programme's difficulties, until the National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee have reported to Parliament. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The National Audit Office is due to publish <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/work_in_progress/nhs_it_progress.aspx" class="tsb">its third report on the National Programme</a> on Wednesday 18 May 2011. The Public Accounts Committee will take evidence on the report on Monday 23 May 2011.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: <strong>&ldquo;I am very  pleased that the Prime Minister stated that no new agreement will be concluded  before the NAO report is published and the Public Accounts Committee has had  the opportunity to consider it.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;It sounded  very much as if all options are now on the table&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">During Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons today, Mr Bacon asked the Prime Minister whether he agreed that the Programme would never deliver its early promise and was scathing about CSC's failure with Lorenzo. Mr Bacon concluded by suggesting  that, rather than squandering the &pound;4.7  billion that remained unspent, there should be a negotiated solution  that  frees up billions of pounds for the benefit of patients?</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Cameron responded: &quot;I agree with my hon. Friend that we are absolutely determined to achieve better value for money. Let me reassure him that there are no plans to sign any new contract with Computer Sciences Corporation until the National Audit Office report has been reviewed and until the Public Accounts Committee meetings and the Major Projects Authority reviews have taken place. The Department of Health and the Cabinet Office will examine all the available options under the current contract, including the option of terminating some of, or indeed all of, the contract&rdquo;. </p>
