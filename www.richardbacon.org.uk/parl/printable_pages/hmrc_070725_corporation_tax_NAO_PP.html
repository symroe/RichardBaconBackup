<h3><span class="bigword4">MP urges taxman to change 
his ways</span></h3>
  <br>
  <p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has called on HM Revenue and Customs to change its operational culture, as a new report finds that 58 per cent of its enquiries into large business Corporation Tax were expected to yield less than one per cent in additional tax yield, but that its tax specialists are reluctant to stop such enquiries. 
  <p class="newsbody"><b> Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;HM Revenue and Customs is expending too much 
    energy pursuing small amounts of Corporation Tax with little chance 
    of a decent return.&nbsp; The Department must change its operational 
    culture so that it works more closely with large businesses and 
    shifts its focus to high levels of tax at risk.&#8221; </b>
  <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon, a 
    member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the 
    National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into the management 
    of large business Corporation Tax.&nbsp; 
  <p class="newsbody">The report finds that in February 2007 HMRC was carrying out 4,700 
    enquiries, 58 per cent of which were expected to produce less than 
    one per cent of the total additional tax yield generated from 
    compliance activities.&nbsp;             
  <p class="newsbody">The culture of opening enquiries even where 
    low amounts of tax are at risk has resulted in large numbers of open 
    enquiries and that tax specialists have shown reluctance to stop 
    these enquiries.
