<p class="newsbody">COMMENTING ON the publication of the National Audit   Office report into Firebuy Ltd., a specialist body set up by the Department for   Communities and Local Government to help Fire and Rescue Services buy vehicles   and equipment, Richard Bacon MP, a member of the Commons public accounts   committee said: </p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;Firebuy, a body established by the   Department for Communities and Local Government to help fire brigades buy   equipment, has cost the taxpayer nearly twice as much to set up and run as the   savings it claims to have delivered.&nbsp; Firebuy was supposed to have been self   financing by 2009, yet it is still heavily reliant on grants from the   Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;Firebuy needs to   persuade England&rsquo;s 46 fire   brigades of the benefits of its services, but only five of Firebuy&rsquo;s 14   procurement contracts have proved popular with local Fire and Rescue Services.&nbsp;   Furthermore, Firebuy has no information on when equipment contracts are due to   expire, which fire brigades are choosing to buy elsewhere or even what products   Firebuy has itself sold through its procurement contracts.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;There are benefits in centralised   procurement, but Firebuy is neither cheap enough nor successful enough to   justify its continued existence.&nbsp; Firebuy has failed to win over England&rsquo;s Fire and Rescue Services   and unless it improves rapidly the Department should pull the plug&rdquo;.&nbsp; </p>
