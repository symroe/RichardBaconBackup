<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has 
  said that dementia sufferers and their carers are losing out on services and 
  support, as a new report finds that tackling 
  dementia is not a priority for the NHS.
  
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;The NHS may be 
  tackling cancer and coronary heart disease head on, but it is losing the 
  fight against dementia.&nbsp; The NHS has no strategy or leadership in place 
  and the belief that nothing can be done to tackle dementia has been 
  allowed to take hold.&nbsp; The NHS must change this mindset without delay&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;The NHS saves &pound;5 
		  billion a year because dementia suffers are being cared for by their 
		  family or friends, many of whom pay a high price for their labour of 
		  love.&nbsp; The NHS must repay this debt and ensure carers get the support to 
		  which they are entitled&#8221;. </b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr. Bacon, MP for South 
		  Norfolk, was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published 
		  its report on improving support for people with dementia.&nbsp; Dementia 
		  costs the NHS &pound;14 billion per year.&nbsp; Although the number of dementia 
		  cases is predicted to increase by 30 per cent over the next 15 years, 
		  the disease is not currently an NHS priority, unlike cancer and coronary 
		  heart disease.&nbsp; There is no single individual with responsibility for 
		  improving dementia services, and the report finds that between a half 
		  and two-thirds of dementia sufferers never receive a diagnosis.&nbsp; The 
		  report also finds that few in the medical profession or the public know 
		  what can be done to help people with the disease.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Informal carers 
		  supporting people with dementia save the NHS and social care over &pound;5 
		  billion per year. These unpaid carers are usually family members and 
		  without the care they provide, the present system of dementia care would 
		  collapse. However, carers are often poorly supported, with few receiving 
		  their entitlement to a carer&#8217;s assessment and many unable to access good 
quality respite care or domiciliary care.</p>
