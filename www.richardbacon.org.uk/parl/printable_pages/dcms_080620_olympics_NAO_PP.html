<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt">SOUTH NORFOLK MP 
  Richard Bacon has said that security for the 2012 Olympic 
  and Paralympic Games is &#8216;non-negotiable&#8217;, as a 
  new report finds that security and policing requirements have not been fully reflected in the planning 
  of the 2012 programme.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;The success of the 2012 Olympics depends on 
  the ability of athletes and spectators to enjoy the Games without 
  fear.&nbsp; Their security is non-negotiable&#8221;.</b>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;We all expect the Games to be safe, but it is 
  hard to understand why there is not a firm basis for taking forward the 
  wider security arrangements for the Games&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;It is almost three years since London won its 
  bid to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, yet the Olympic Board 
  still does not have a complete analysis of the risks involved.&nbsp; Three 
  years is more than enough time to come up with a coherent breakdown of 
  risks and it is odd that this hasn&#8217;t been done yet.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office 
  published its progress report on preparations for the 2012 Olympic and 
  Paralympic Games.&nbsp; The report finds that, in 
  the continuing absence of a fully costed plan, there is not a firm basis 
  for making sure that wider security requirements have been fully 
  reflected in the planning and delivery of other activities within the 
  London 2012 programme, including the construction of the venues, 
  transport and staging. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">The report focuses on how risk management for the 
  Olympic programme as a whole has been brought together and finds that 
  the Government Olympic Executive is not yet in a position to provide the 
  Olympic Board with a complete analysis of the strategic risks to 
  delivery of the programme.</p>
