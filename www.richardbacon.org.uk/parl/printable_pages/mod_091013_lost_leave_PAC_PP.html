<p class="bwp4">MP calls for action on troops' lost leave</p>

<p class="newsbody">Commenting on </span>the publication of the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report on the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s support for high-intensity operations, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said: </p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;In 2008-09 almost half of all flights out of Afghanistan were delayed.
  The government says it is trying to minimise delays to the airbridge and, of 
  course, everyone understands that flying in and out of a hot, dusty 
  war zone is a fraught business, but our troops deserve better than 
  this.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold" style="text-align: justify">&ldquo;At present, the 
  clock starts ticking for armed forces&rsquo; leave the moment they are due 
  to embark from the war zone.&nbsp; This is quite unfair to armed forces 
  personnel, who see little enough of their families as it is without 
  the precious time they are given being eroded because the MoD can&rsquo;t 
  get them home on time.&nbsp; Leave should begin for our troops when they 
  arrive in the UK rather than starting when they are still in the war 
  zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbold" style="text-align: justify">&#8220;The MoD says it is 
  looking at other options to compensate soldiers who lose out on 
  precious Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R), such as extending their time 
  on leave after their tour is complete.&nbsp; By then, however, the heavy 
  tempo of operations may have already taken its toll, especially if 
  troops&#8217; mid-tour R&amp;R leave had previously been disrupted by delays 
  and missed connections. &nbsp;Simply telling exhausted troops &#8216;we&#8217;ll make 
  it up to you later&#8217; is not good enough&#8221;<span class="newsbold" style="text-align: justify">.</span>&nbsp; </font></b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee 
  published its report on the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s support for 
  high-intensity operations.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> In answer to a Parliamentary Question in July 
  2009, the MoD confirmed that 48 per cent of all RAF flights from 
  Afghanistan to the UK faced delays of over one hour, with 23 per 
  cent of flights delayed for over three hours.&nbsp; </font>In a 
  memorandum to the committee, the MoD stated that it was looking at 
  the alternative option of extending post operational tour leave by 
  way of compensation for those who lose out on Rest and Recuperation 
  as a result of travel delays.</p>
