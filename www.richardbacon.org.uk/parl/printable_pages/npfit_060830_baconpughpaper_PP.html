		computer crash</p>

	
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">
		<b>Government &#8216;convincing no-one&#8217; 
		over NHS computers, say MPs</b><br>
		<br>
		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">MPs have asked</span> the NHS to rethink plans for upgrading its computer systems to avoid the programme &#8216;sleepwalking to disaster&#8217; and wasting billions of pounds.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">
		The upgrade of NHS computers, the largest IT project in the world, has been dogged by controversy and criticised for over-centralisation. The programme&#8217;s largest software supplier, iSoft, 
		is under investigation by the Financial Services Authority for possible 
		accounting irregularities.
<p class="newsbody">Meanwhile, the US information technology group 
		Accenture, a prime contractor for two of the five regions in the 
		project, has refused to rule out replacing iSoft and industry observers believe Accenture is negotiating to exit from the programme.</p>
		<p class="newsbody">Two members of the influential Commons public accounts committee have called for the programme to be decentralised and for more control to be given to hospitals locally.  The call comes in a 
		<a class="tsb" href="../WHAT_NEXT_FOR_NHS_IT.rtf">paper</a> issued today by Richard Bacon, the Conservative MP for South Norfolk, and John Pugh, Liberal Democrat MP for Southport.  Under the MPs&#8217; plans, hospital chief executives across the country would be given personal responsibility and funding for purchasing systems locally according to national standards.  
</p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>Extracts from the MPs&#8217; paper: <br>
		<br>
		&#8220;The government is convincing no one that the situation is under 
		control. The National Programme for IT in the NHS is currently 
		sleepwalking towards disaster. It is far behind schedule. Projected 
		costs have spiralled. Key software systems have little chance of ever 
		working properly. Clinical staff are losing confidence in it. Many local 
		Trusts are considering opting out of the programme altogether. These 
		problems are a consequence of over-centralisation, over-ambition and an 
		obsession with quick political fixes&#8221;. <br>
		<br>
		&#8220;Since its inception, the cost of the National Programme has risen to an 
		estimated £15 billion &#8211; enough money to run thirty hospitals, with all 
		their doctors, nurses, drugs and operations, for five years&#8221;. <br>
		<br>
		&#8220;The fundamental error made when setting up the programme was to assume 
		that centralised procurement of single systems across the NHS would be 
		more efficient than local decision-making guided by national standards&#8221;.<br>
		<br>
		&#8220;The complex, extremely expensive and high risk local systems 
		replacement project should be reformed so that local hospital Trusts can 
		purchase locally systems which link into the national framework&#8221;. <br>
		<br>
		&#8220;A reformed programme can still be rescued. Recent publicity and the 
		shake-up already underway among Local Service Providers and key 
		contractors provide an opportunity to do this, which must not be missed. 
		What is required is to create a proper balance between central standards 
		and central procurement where this offers demonstrable benefits, and 
		local autonomy and responsibility. IT offers enormous potential benefits 
		to the NHS, its staff and above all its patients. It is not too late to 
		make sure that these benefits are properly delivered&#8221;.<br>
		<br>
		</b>The public accounts committee took evidence on the NHS computer 
		programme on 26 June, since when there have been a number of 
		revelations.<b><br>
		<br>
		Richard Bacon MP said: &#8220;Since we completed the committee hearing at the 
		end of June, there is much new information now publicly available. I am 
		concerned that the public accounts committee may not have had the full 
		facts available at the hearing&#8221;. <br>
		<br>
		&#8220;Two of the prime contractors, CSC and Accenture, have stated that the 
		largest software supplier to the NHS computer programme, iSoft, has &#8216;no 
		believable plans&#8217; for future releases of its key product, Lorenzo, while 
		iSoft is itself under investigation for possible financial 
		irregularities. An opinion poll showing declining support among NHS 
		staff was not made available to the Committee&#8221;. <br>
		<br>
		&#8220;This programme is costing taxpayers a King&#8217;s ransom but it is 
		descending into chaos. Our paper proposes a solution which would reduce 
		the scale, cost and risk of the National Programme and accelerate the 
		delivery of benefits to all NHS staff&#8221;.</b></p>

<p class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none">There are four chief reasons why the National 
		Programme for IT in the NHS is in trouble:
<font size="1"><ol style="margin-right:15pt">
	<li class="liltext">It has little support from anyone outside the National Programme and the 
		suppliers delivering the systems. &nbsp;According to a IPSOS Mori poll 
		commissioned by Connecting for Health and completed in February 2006 
		(but not released until 21 July, after the PAC hearing on 26 June), the 
		more people know about the programme, the lower their level of support.&nbsp; 
		Doctors are up in arms about patient confidentiality, many leading 
		academics are expressing serious concerns about the programmes 
		architecture and a growing number of NHS trusts are voting with their 
		feet and withdrawing from the programme.</li><br>
&nbsp;<br>
		<li class="liltext">More and more instances are being reported of the system compromising 
		patient care. &nbsp;The programme left eighty Trusts entirely without 
		computers for 4 days in the largest system crash in NHS history. 
		Vaccination rates in London dropped by up to 19% following failures in 
		BT&#8217;s child health system.&nbsp; Patient records disappeared throughout the 
		North West region following a series of software errors. &nbsp;The Nuffield 
		Orthopaedic Hospital in Oxford lost track of so many patients that this 
		single small hospital increased national breaches of Government waiting 
		list targets by a factor of 8.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li class="liltext">The programme is running impossibly late.&nbsp; Of more than 100 acute 
		hospitals that were supposed to have a system installed by April 2006, 
		only 12 did so. The iSoft product Lorenzo has not been called installed 
		anywhere.</li><br>
		<br>
		<li class="liltext">The supplier community is in chaos and Connecting for Health is 
		jumping from fire to fire. &nbsp;Accenture has written off $450 million US 
		dollars against the programme; IDX, the primary software supplier for 
		the South, has been replaced by Cerner and is rumoured to be in the 
		process of being replaced by Cerner in London.&nbsp; Two and a half years 
		into the Programme, BT has achieved so little that it has earned only 
		£1.3m against its £996 million London Local Service Provider contract. 
		Fujitsu/Cerner failed to deliver the eight Trusts they promised by 
		Easter 2006 and have already missed a number of delivery dates given to 
		the PAC just weeks ago in June 2006.&nbsp; iSOFT, the primary software 
		supplier for 3/5th of England, has slipped its development schedules by 
		years and is on its knees financially.</li> </ol>
