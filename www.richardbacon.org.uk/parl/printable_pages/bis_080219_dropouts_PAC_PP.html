<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Better data on drop-outs needed, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
  Bacon has called on the government to get better data on why students 
  choose to drop out of their courses, as a new report finds that an &pound;800 
  million investment has failed to cut the drop-out rate.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;Despite a government investment of &pound;800 million over the last five years to help universities hang on to students, the drop-out rate has refused to budge.&nbsp; One in five students is still failing to complete courses and the government has little idea why.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Personal or 
  financial problems, illness or disappointment with the choice of 
  university may be behind a student&#8217;s decision to leave.&nbsp; The 
  government needs to get more detailed data on what drives students 
  to quit their courses if it is to cut the drop-out rate&#8221;.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr. Bacon, MP for 
  South Norfolk, was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee 
  published its report on the retention of students on higher 
  education courses.&nbsp; Over the last five years, universities have 
  received around &pound;800 million to help them retain students.&nbsp; However, 
  over that period the percentage of students not completing their 
  courses remained at 22 per cent. &nbsp;Over 100,000 students who started 
  first-degree courses in 2004-05 failed to complete their first year.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The little data 
  that is collected on why students withdraw from their courses is 
  often incomplete and inconsistent.&nbsp; For example, little is known 
  about the extent to which mental or physical illness or domestic 
  circumstances contribute to withdrawal. &nbsp;The report finds that 
  universities need good quality information on the reasons for 
  leaving. This can help universities to provide additional support 
  for students, for example for those struggling with elements of 
  their course. </p>
