		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has described the government body set up to recover the proceeds of crime as a &#8216;total shambles&#8217;, as a new report finds that the Assets Recovery Agency has missed its targets for recovering criminals&#8217; assets and that nearly all the financial investigators trained by the Agency are at risk of losing their accreditation.
		
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
		<b>Mr Bacon said today:  &#8220;The Assets Recovery Agency was meant to seize the proceeds of crime but the Agency cannot even recover enough to meet its own costs.  As a result, most crime barons seem unlikely to lose their ill-gotten mansions and yachts any time soon&#8221;.  
		</b>  
<p class="newsbody">
<b>&#8220;Most of the financial investigators trained by the Agency are at risk losing their accreditation.  Fraudulent activity in the UK is expanding rapidly and the UK cannot afford to lose trained financial investigators.  The successor bodies to the Assets Recovery Agency must make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen&#8221;.   
		</b>
		<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts 
		committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office published its 
		report into the Assets Recovery Agency today (Wednesday 21 February 
		2007).&nbsp; The report finds that when the agency was set up in 2003, no 
		prior feasibility study was carried out to assess its likely 
		performance, or to devise appropriate targets.&nbsp; The Agency is also 
		supposed to finance itself from recovered assets, but so far it has 
		recovered £23 million, against cumulative costs of £65 million.&nbsp; The 
		Agency expects to break even by 2009-10, but this cannot be supported by 
		financial modelling.</p>
		<p class="newsbody">From April next year, the asset recovery work of 
		the Agency will transfer to the Serious Organised Crime Agency and its 
		training role passes to the new National Policing Improvement Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		</p>
		<p class="newsbody">The Agency has a statutory duty to train financial 
		investigators and monitor their accreditation.&nbsp; However, the report 
		finds that 90 per cent of investigators on the Agency&#8217;s database risk 
		losing their accreditation because they have not completed their 
		Continuing Personal Development activities.&nbsp;  </p>
