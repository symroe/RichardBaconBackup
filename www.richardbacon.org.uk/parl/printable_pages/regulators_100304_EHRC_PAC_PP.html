<p class="newsbody">AN MP ON the public accounts committee has condemned 
		the &#8220;&pound;1 million revolving door&#8221; for quango bosses who were given large 
		redundancy payments and then re-hired as consultants due to staff 
		shortages. 
<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report on the 
  Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), South Norfolk MP Richard 
  Bacon, a member of the committee, said:</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Seven senior employees of the Equality and Human Rights Commission were given a 
  total of &pound;630,000 in redundancy payments and then hurriedly re-hired as 
  consultants at a further cost of &pound;338,000 because of staff shortages.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The Equality and Human Rights Commission took over from the Commission for 
  Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities 
  Commission in October 2007.&nbsp; The new commission required fewer staff than its 
  predecessor bodies and so the former commissions offered their staff voluntary 
  redundancy as part of an &pound;11.1 million &#8216;early exit&#8217; scheme.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;However, the new Commission had no control over who was being offered voluntary 
  redundancy. The resulting rush for the door left the Commission 140 people 
  short, with skill gaps in key areas.&nbsp; Seven senior staff who had already left 
  under the &#8216;early exit&#8217; scheme at a cost of &pound;630,000 were hurriedly re-hired as 
  consultants, costing a further &pound;338,000. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;This expenditure could have been avoided if there had been some basic planning. 
  Taxpayers have the right to expect that the government will take better care of 
  their hard-earned taxes. Unsurprisingly, the Treasury refused to give 
  retrospective approval for this &pound;1 million revolving door and these 
  irregularities forced Parliament&#8217;s financial watchdog, the National Audit 
  Office, to place a black mark against the Commission&#8217;s accounts&#8221;.</p>
