<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the Commons public accounts 
  committee&#8217;s report on how HM Revenue &amp; Customs deals with the tax affairs of 
  older people, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, 
  said:
<p class="newsbold"><b> &#8220;Around 1.5 million older 
  people have overpaid the taxman by a total of around &pound;250 million because of 
  discrepancies between the tax records held by the government and the records 
  of employers and pension providers.&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p class="newsbold"><b> &#8220;Furthermore, many older 
    people are not claiming the age-related tax allowances they are entitled to, 
    because HMRC makes people jump through hoops even though the government 
    should already know whether someone is eligible for an allowance or not. </b></p>
  <p class="newsbold"><b> &#8220;People&#8217;s tax affairs often 
    become more complicated as they get older, but the tax system cannot cope 
    properly with what are often multiple sources of income for older people.&nbsp; 
    The UK&#8217;s population is ageing, so it is only going to get harder to deal 
    with the taxation of older people unless HMRC takes action to address these 
    issues.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbold"><b> &#8220;HMRC is letting pensioners 
    down and it needs to work much harder to make the tax affairs of older 
    people easier to understand&#8221;.</b>
