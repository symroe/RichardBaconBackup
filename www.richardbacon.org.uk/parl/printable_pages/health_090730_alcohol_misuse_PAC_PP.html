<p class="newsbody"style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">				SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has 
				written to Norfolk&#8217;s health chiefs to ask what action NHS 
				Norfolk is taking to tackle alcohol abuse, as a hard-hitting 
				report finds that alcohol misuse is costing the NHS £2.7 billion 
				a year. </p>
				<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0pt">
				Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, 
				said: </p>
				<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0pt">
				<b>				&#8220;On weekend nights between midnight and 5am, 
				nearly three-quarters of attendances at hospital accident and 
				emergency departments are alcohol-related.&#8221;  Alcohol is a factor in 38 per cent of domestic 
				violence cases and, in 2006-07, there were over 800,000 
				alcohol-related hospital admissions, an increase of 71 per cent 
				in the last four years alone.&nbsp; The evidence is clear: England 
				has a drink problem.&#8221;&nbsp;</b></p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>				&#8220;Despite the 
				shocking scale of alcohol abuse, many Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) 
				are failing to grasp the nettle and take action.&nbsp; The report 
				finds that 22 per cent of PCTs had not assessed the local need 
				for alcohol misuse services since January 2004 and only 58 per 
				cent of PCTs were developing a local alcohol strategy.&nbsp; PCTs 
				rightly decide on what their priorities should be locally but, 
				for many Trusts, there is little correlation between need and 
				expenditure.&#8221;&nbsp; </b></p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>				&#8220;Earlier this 
				week, the Greater Norfolk coroner expressed his concern over the 
				increasing number of alcohol-related deaths and the latest 
				figures show that 14,330 people were hospitalised last year in 
				Norfolk due to alcohol-related harm.&nbsp; I have written to NHS 
				Norfolk, asking them to examine this report closely and to let 
				me know what steps they are taking to combat the rising tide of 
				alcohol misuse.&#8221;</b></p>
				<p class="newsbody">				Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
				Commons public accounts committee published its report on 
				England&#8217;s health services for alcohol misuse.&nbsp; The report finds that a<span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt">lcohol 
				misuse is a significant and growing problem in England, with 
				more than 10 million people regularly drinking above the 
				guidelines set by the government. &nbsp;Alcohol misuse places a 
				considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS), 
				costing an estimated £2.7 billion per year. &nbsp;In 2006&#8211;07, there 
				were some 811,000 alcohol-related hospital admissions, 
				representing a 71 per cent increase in four years. Between 12 
				and 5am on weekend nights, nearly three-quarters of all 
				attendances at accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments are 
				alcohol-related.&nbsp; According to the 2008-09 British Crime Survey, 
				38 per cent of cases of domestic violence occurred when the 
				offender was under the influence of alcohol. </span></p>
				<p class="newsbody">				The report finds that Primary Care 
				Trusts (PCTs) are responsible for determining local health 
				priorities and have control over the majority of NHS spending. 
				PCTs are free to decide for themselves how much to spend on 
				services to address alcohol harm. Many PCTs, however, do not 
				know what they spend on such services and across England there 
				is little correlation between need and expenditure. Where 
				services are commissioned there is frequently a lack of 
				performance monitoring and examination of whether what is 
				provided represents value for money.</p>
				<p class="newsbody">				Earlier this week, Greater Norfolk 
				coroner Mr William Armstrong warned that an 
				
				increasing number of deaths in the county were alcohol-related. 
				&nbsp;According to the Association of Public Health Observatories, 
				14,300 people were admitted to hospital in Norfolk last year due 
to alcohol-related harm.&nbsp;
