<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has expressed concern that a &pound;1 billion scheme intended to provide top-class facilities for GPs and other primary care practitioners may prove too costly to roll out across England. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report into the NHS Local Improvement Finance Trusts (LIFTs).  
<p class="newsbody">LIFT is a finance scheme whereby ageing GP surgeries are replaced with first-class facilities which put a range of local healthcare professionals under one roof. 
  However, early signs indicate the scheme will be far more expensive than existing funding arrangements.
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"> For example, the annual average cost for primary care accommodation in 
  Newham primary care trust is &pound;10.20 per patient, whereas under NHS LIFT 
  the cost is &pound;32.20 per patient. Only 8.9 per cent of Newham&#8217;s patients 
  are served by LIFT facilities.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">This disparity is 
  found elsewhere.&nbsp; The annual average cost for primary care accommodation 
  in the Ashton, Leigh and Wigan area is &pound;6.90 per patient, which is less 
  than a quarter of the expenditure under NHS LIFT of &pound;29.23 per patient.&nbsp; 
  In Ashton, Leigh and Wigan, 10.7 per cent of patients are served by NHS 
  LIFT facilities.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">There is an even 
  greater discrepancy in the Sandwell area in the West Midlands, where the 
  annual average cost for primary care accommodation is &pound;3.84, compared 
  with &pound;31.41 per patient for NHS LIFT facilities. Around 6.3 percent of 
  Sandwell&#8217;s patients are served by LIFT facilities.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon, a member of 
  the committee, said: &#8220;That the LIFT 
  scheme provides high-quality facilities for patients is not in doubt.&nbsp; 
  What <i>is</i> in doubt is whether this level of spending is 
  sustainable.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;It is likely that much better value for money would be 
  achieved by giving greater control of how funds are spent to local GPs, 
  for example through a standard cost-rent scheme. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;GPs are more than 
  capable of managing and developing new facilities in a cost-effective 
  way&#8221;.&nbsp;</b></p>
