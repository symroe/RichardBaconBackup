<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has called for farmers to 
  be vigilant in maintaining 'biosecure' farms if they want to avoid footing the 
  bill for a future Foot and Mouth epidemic.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the 
  Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the committee's report on the 
  lessons learnt from the 2001 Foot and Mouth outbreak was published. &nbsp;The report suggests that any future changes in the 
  way the costs of an outbreak are met could be linked to standards in biosecurity 
  maintained on a farm.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;Ensuring good biosecurity is vital in 
  preventing another outbreak of Foot and Mouth.&nbsp; Most farmers are highly vigilant 
  against disease, but anyone who tries to cut corners could put his own and 
  others' livelihoods at risk. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;The Government must also do its share.&nbsp; Last time 
  DEFRA was woefully ill-prepared to deal with the foot and mouth outbreak. 
  Although there may have been some improvement, there remain important areas for 
  concern, such as the level of control over imported meat which is not always 
  produced to our animal welfare standards and may be more prone to disease&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The report also calls on the Department for the Environment, 
  Food and Rural Affairs to be sure that any national contingency plan to deal 
  with another outbreak is matched with effective strategies by local authorities 
  and emergency services.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon added: &ldquo;I am pleased that DEFRA now has its 
  national contingency plan in place, but the Government must ensure that relevant 
  bodies at all levels have suitable plans in place too.&nbsp; Given the enormous costs 
  of the 2001 outbreak, we cannot afford to leave anything to chance&rdquo;.</p>
