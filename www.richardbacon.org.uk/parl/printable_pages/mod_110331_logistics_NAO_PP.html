  <p class="newsbody">Commenting on the publication of the National Audit Office&rsquo;s  report into how the Ministry of Defence manages the delivery of equipment to  military operations, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons  public accounts committee, said:</p>
		<p class="newsbold">&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;The Ministry of Defence has had problems with the supply  chain for military equipment for decades. The MoD naturally wants to get our  troops what they need as soon as it can, but it is wasting money by sending too  many routine items by air. </strong></p>
		<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;While the MoD says 80 per cent of supplies should be  sent by surface shipping and only 20 per cent by air, in practice most  equipment is sent by air, and in Afghanistan the split has been 70/30 in favour  of air transport.&nbsp; Many routine items are being flown to Afghanistan and  switching just 10 per cent of cargo to surface routes could save &pound;15 million a  year.</strong></p>
		<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;The MoD isn&rsquo;t collecting enough of the information it  needs to manage the supply chain properly, and some of the MoD&rsquo;s inventory  management systems pre-date the fall of the Berlin Wall and are no longer  supported by the manufacturers. If these systems fail, the consequences at the  front line could be severe&quot;.</strong></p>
		<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;While the military supply chain plainly faces challenges  that commercial operations don&rsquo;t, there is also much that is the same.&nbsp;  Too much of the MoD&rsquo;s supply chain is operating on a wing and a prayer and the  Ministry needs to do more to drag its logistics operations into the 21st  century&rdquo;.</strong></p>
