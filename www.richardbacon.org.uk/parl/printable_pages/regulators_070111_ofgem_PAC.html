<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Consumers must benefit from gas deal, 
says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon has called on gas regulator Ofgem to make sure consumers do not have to wait until the year 2013 to benefit from the &pound;5.8 billion sale of four of the UK&#8217;s eight regional gas distribution networks.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report into Ofgem&#8217;s role in the sale of gas distribution networks. </p>
<p class="newsbody">In June 2005 
  National Grid sold four of its eight regional gas distribution 
  networks for &pound;5.8&nbsp;billion. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets 
  (Ofgem), whose primary statutory duty is to protect consumers, was 
  responsible for approving the sales. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Ofgem concluded 
  that the potential benefits for customers from the sales could be 
  &pound;325&nbsp;million over the period 2008 to 2023.&nbsp; However, Ofgem also 
  predicted that 80 per cent of these savings would not come until 
  after 2013 and is not confident that the benefits will be achieved.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon said 
  today:</p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Consumers 
  should not have to wait until 2013 before they can benefit from the 
  &pound;325 million in savings. Even this works out at only &pound;1 per consumer 
  per year, which is hardly anything given the climbing price of gas&#8221;.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Ofgem&#8217;s first 
  and most important duty is to get the best deal for consumers, who 
  are getting very little out of the sale of these four networks.&nbsp; 
  Ofgem must make sure consumers get some benefit from these deals 
  sooner rather than later and that the savings identified do not 
  disappear without a trace&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
