<p class="bwp4">HMRC 'becoming a punchline', says MP</span><br>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span> MP Richard Bacon has said that HM Revenue and Customs, the troubled department at the heart of the lost disc scandal, is becoming a punchline, as a new report finds that there are deficiencies in HMRC&#8217;s management information.
  
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;In the wake of the lost data scandal, it will 
  surprise no-one that HMRC has holes in its management information.&nbsp; HMRC 
  really is in a mess if it doesn&#8217;t know which businesses are persistently 
  failing to submit their tax returns&#8221;. &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The name &#8216;HM Revenue &amp; Customs&#8217; is fast becoming 
		  the punch line to a very bad joke.&nbsp; HMRC must get a grip on its 
		  management information and find out which businesses are not paying 
		  their taxes or submitting their returns.&nbsp; Until HMRC addresses these 
		  issues, billions of pounds in unpaid tax will be put at risk every 
		  year&#8221;.</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts 
		  committee published its report into the filing of VAT and Company Tax 
		  returns.&nbsp; Some 1.8 million businesses are registered for VAT and 1.8 
		  million companies registered to file Company Tax returns. 600,000 
		  businesses file both types of return.&nbsp; HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) 
		  collects &pound;129 billion a year in VAT and Corporation Tax from these 
		  businesses.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
		<p class="newsbody">However, the report finds that at least &pound;1.5 billion 
		  of tax revenue was estimated to be in doubt from late and missing 
		  returns in October 2006.&nbsp; HMRC does not know which businesses 
		  persistently failed to submit a return or how many businesses fail to 
		  submit both their VAT and Company Tax returns.&nbsp; It also had no detailed 
		  understanding of whether there was a link between late filing and 
		  inaccurate returns. </p>
