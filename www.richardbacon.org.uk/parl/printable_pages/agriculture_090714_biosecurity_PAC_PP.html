				<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the publication of the Commons 
				public accounts committee&#8217;s report into the health of livestock 
				and honeybees in England, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a 
				member of the committee, said today (<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;">Tuesday 
				14 July 2009):</span></p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Unless serious animal diseases are 
				brought under control quickly, they pose significant threats to 
				human health, animal welfare, the economy and the environment.&nbsp; 
				The economic consequences are also devastating for individual 
				farmers and their families&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Common standards on biosecurity would 
				help farmers and beekeepers to minimise the risk of animal 
				diseases spreading, but it is important that Defra does not try 
				to impose standards by diktat.&nbsp; Defra must work with farmers to 
				agree practical and achievable standards&#8221;.</b></p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The importance of protecting the UK&#8217;s 
				honeybees cannot be overstated, as we depend on these creatures 
				to pollinate crops.&nbsp; Honeybees have been hit hard by parasites 
				and disease in recent years, but Defra still lacks a complete 
				picture of the situation.&nbsp; It is worrying that Defra cannot 
				explain why there have been over 8,000 reported outbreaks of 
				notifiable bee diseases in England over the last decade, yet 
				only three in Scotland.&nbsp; Defra should work with beekeepers and 
				inspectors to establish the reasons behind the high incidence of 
				disease south of the border&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
				<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public 
				accounts committee published its report into the health of 
				livestock and honeybees.&nbsp; The report finds that adapting 
				rigorous biosecurity standards could limit disease impact and 
				incidence, but that the Department for Environment, Food and 
				Rural Affairs (Defra) has made little progress in establishing 
				minimum biosecurity standards.&nbsp; The report recommends that Defra 
				and its agency, Animal Health, should work with the farming 
				industry to develop biosecurity standards appropriate to 
				different livestock sectors. </p>
				<p class="newsbody">Around 39 commercial crops grown in Great 
				Britain, with an estimated value of some £200 million a year to 
				the agricultural economy, rely on insect pollination. Despite 
				their importance to the agricultural economy, the Department has 
				given little priority to bee health.&nbsp; English beekeepers have 
				reported unusually high losses of honeybees in recent years, but 
				regular inspections of honeybee colonies enable Defra to monitor 
				the health of colonies and the incidence of disease and 
				parasites.&nbsp; The effectiveness of these inspections is hampered 
				because around half of the estimated 37,000 active beekeepers in 
				England have not joined the Department&#8217;s voluntary register, 
				BeeBase.&nbsp; The report also finds that Scotland has little 
				reported disease, with only three detected cases in the last ten 
				years, compared with 8,071 in England and 463 in Wales.&nbsp; </div>
