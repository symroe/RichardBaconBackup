<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Diplomas could become &ldquo;Betamax&rdquo; qualifications, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, has warned that the new Diplomas 
  that have been introduced by the government could become &#8216;Betamax&#8217; qualifications:&nbsp; unpopular, unsupported and unlikely to be around for long.
<p class="newsbold"> Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The government has admitted that the choices facing students 
  at 14 and 16 are already too complicated. &nbsp;However, without 
  rationalising existing qualifications, Diplomas just muddy the 
  waters and put more pressure on young people&#8221;. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;What&#8217;s more, top independent schools 
  have already turned their backs on Diplomas and attempts to make 
  Diplomas appealing to universities have angered the CBI. 
  Universities, employers and teachers are not yet convinced that 
  Diplomas will work&#8221;.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Unless this changes soon, Diplomas 
  could become &#8216;Betamax&#8217; qualifications: unpopular, unsupported 
  and unlikely to be around for long&#8221;.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee 
  published its report into the government&#8217;s preparations to 
  deliver the 14-19 education reforms in England.&nbsp; The report finds that Diplomas have yet to be 
  widely accepted as credible qualifications.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The employers&#8217; organisation the CBI said 
  earlier this year that government plans for Diplomas in academic 
  subjects in England would not have any greater value to young 
  people or to employers than the existing GCSEs or A levels, and 
  would instead be an unnecessary distraction.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Independent Schools Council has said 
  that unless all universities make the achievement of an Advanced 
  Diploma a pre-requisite for entry to higher education, it is 
  inconceivable that a Diploma framework will command support and 
  respect.&nbsp; </p>
