<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Public sector procurement in a 
  mess, says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has said that public sector procurement is in a mess as a new report finds that the work of OGCbuying.solutions, 
  the Treasury's central purchasing agency, is being duplicated by over 50 other agencies across Whitehall and the wider public sector.  
  
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;Over 50 public sector agencies are doing a similar job to OGCbuying.solutions, with many offering the same products and services&#8221;. </b>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Public sector procurement is in a total mess and this uncoordinated approach is costing the taxpayer dearly&#8221;. </b>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;OGCbuying.solutions could potentially save &pound;660 million if it could get its act together, but that is unlikely to happen whilst the public sector&#8217;s approach to buying goods and services is so disorganised&#8221;. </b>
        <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts 
          committee published its report into the performance of 
          OGCbuying.solutions.&nbsp; In 2005&#8211;06, OGCbuying.solutions reported value for 
          money savings of &pound;412 million, but the National Audit Office (NAO) has 
          identified a further &pound;520 million to &pound;660 million of savings over the 
          next 3&#8211;5 years that OGCbuying.solutions could make by improving its 
          performance.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="newsbody">The report also finds that public sector procurement 
          is uncoordinated, with OGCbuying.solutions just one of over 50 public 
          sector procurement organisations operating across the UK.&nbsp; This lack of 
          co-ordination results in organisations paying more than they should for 
          goods and services.&nbsp; For example, the NAO found a 139 per cent 
          difference between the highest and lowest prices paid for a 12-pack of 
          post-it notes.&nbsp; Meanwhile prices paid for a toner cartridge ranged 
          between &pound;41 and &pound;89, a 115 per cent difference.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon added: &#8220;It is no surprise that 
          government is paying silly prices for basic supplies.&nbsp; It is relatively 
          easy for an MP to browse the internet and find top brands at lower 
          prices than Parliament&#8217;s official supplier can offer.&nbsp; My office has 
          already saved hundreds of pounds on printers just by shopping around&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
