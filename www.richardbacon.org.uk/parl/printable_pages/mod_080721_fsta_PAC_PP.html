<p class="bwp4">RAF transport planes 'too costly' to use in Afghanistan, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has said that the Ministry of Defence should avoid using the Private Finance Initiative to pay for vital military capabilities, as a report on the Ministry of Defence&rsquo;s Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) project finds that, despite assuming it would use PFI in 1997, the MoD failed to consider any alternatives until 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify" > The Ministry of Defence is unlikely to allow the new aircraft   to fly into high-threat environments such as Afghanistan because of the   potential impact of fitting the aircraft with the necessary defensive equipment   on the costs of the PFI deal.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee,   said: &ldquo;The MoD assumed it would use PFI in 1997 but it took the   ministry another decade to check whether PFI actually offered the best value for   money.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;In 2004, the MoD&rsquo;s own project team recommended scrapping the PFI in   favour of conventional procurement but, as this would have meant cancelling   another project in its place, the MoD ignored the recommendation, preferring to   have its cake and eat it.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;It is unbelievable that it took the MoD until 2006 to   decide that these planes should be able to fly into Afghanistan, five years   after British troops were first deployed there.&nbsp; The MoD is still dithering even   now over whether it can afford to fit the equipment needed to fly into dangerous   environments, but the impact these changes would have on the PFI&rsquo;s costs will   probably keep these aircraft well away from Afghan airspace.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;The MoD has bought helicopters that cannot fly in cloud,   radios that won&rsquo;t fit in tanks or jeeps and warships that sail without weapons.&nbsp;   Now it has signed a deal for military transport planes which cannot fly to   warzones.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did it never occur to those running this project that the aircraft   might be needed in war?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;No other country in the world uses private finance   arrangements to buy this type of defence equipment and now we know why.&nbsp; The MoD   should avoid using PFI to deliver vital military capabilities&rdquo;.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align:justify" >Mr Bacon was speaking as a new report on the Ministry of   Defence&rsquo;s Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) project was published.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align:justify" >In March 2008, the Ministry of Defence signed a   27-year contract worth &pound;10.5 billion with AirTanker Ltd for 14 Airbus A330   aircraft to provide passenger transport and air-to-air refuelling services, the   largest Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract the MoD has signed.&nbsp; The   report finds that the MoD&rsquo;s use of PFI to deliver a vital military capability   like FSTA was inappropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"  class="newsbody">The report also criticises the MoD for failing to take the   decisions necessary to fit the new aircraft with the defensive equipment needed   to operate in a high-threat environments such as Afghanistan.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify"  class="newsbody">In his evidence   to the committee, MoD Permanent Secretary Sir Bill Jeffrey told MPs that, had   the PFI been scrapped and the FSTA project brought back onto the MoD&rsquo;s balance   sheets, the department would have been immediately faced with affordability   issues and would have had to knock something else off in its place if the   project was to proceed.</p>
