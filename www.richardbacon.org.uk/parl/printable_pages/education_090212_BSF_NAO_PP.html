</div>
	<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the National Audit Office report on renewing the secondary school estate through the Building Schools for the Future programme, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said:
</p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The Department for Children, Schools and Families said it wanted 200 secondary schools rebuilt, refurbished or re-equipped by December 2008, yet only 42 schools were completed by this deadline and the programme&#8217;s costs have soared.</b>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The Department would now have to complete 250 schools every year in order to renew all of England&#8217;s 3,500 secondary schools by 2020.  This is unrealistic.</b>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Time and 
				again, key government projects suffer huge cost or time overruns 
				because Whitehall deludes itself with far-fetched assumptions 
				and unrealistic targets.&nbsp; Programmes like Building Schools for 
				the Future will continue to run into trouble unless government 
				departments stop kidding themselves over the scale of the 
challenges involved.&#8221;</p>
				<p class="newsbody">
				Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
				National Audit Office published its report into the Building 
				Schools for the Future programme.&nbsp; The programme aims to rebuild, refurbish and provide new 
				Information Technology for all 3,500 secondary schools in 
				England by 2020. </p>
				<p class="newsbody">
				The report finds that the 
				Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) 
				underestimated how long it would take to launch the programme 
				and build the schools.&nbsp; The total cost of renewing the secondary 
				school estate will be between £52 billion to £55 billion which 
				is £7 billion to £10 billion more than was estimated at the 
				outset of the programme.&nbsp; To include all schools in the 
				programme, the report also finds that 250 schools will need to 
				be built a year, meaning the number of schools in procurement 
				and construction at any one time will need to double from 2011 
				onwards.
