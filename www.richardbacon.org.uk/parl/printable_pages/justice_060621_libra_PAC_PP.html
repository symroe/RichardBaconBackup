<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has established that the cost of the long-delayed Libra  computer system for the courts has risen to &pound;487 million, more than triple the original cost. </b> </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon learned of the increase in the cost of the system during a hearing of the Commons public accounts committee.  Libra's current projected cost is &pound;487 million, &pound;97 million more than the previous forecast cost of &pound;390 million.  The original contract for Libra was for &pound;156 million.
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee said:
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>"You almost couldn't make this up. The Libra Project was the worst ever PFI computer project we have examined. The national audit office reported to us in January 2003 that costs had more than tripled for a system that just didn't work properly". </b>
        <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>"More than 3 years later it still doesn't work, in fact it is still at "pilot" stage after ten years, and now we discover that the Department for Constitutional Affairs is throwing nearly 
          &pound;100 million extra at this disaster despite being fully aware they will soon replace the system completely. This is an extremely high price to pay for saving face." </b>
