<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span> MP Richard Bacon has said the shortage of soldiers, sailors and airmen is now larger than the number of armed forces personnel currently deployed in Afghanistan. 


<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">
Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report into recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces.&nbsp; The report finds that the impact of continuous downsizing and overstretch is affecting the MoD&#8217;s ability to provide a satisfactory life for Armed Forces personnel and that this has lead to an increase in those leaving the Armed Forces early.<p class="newsbody">
<b>Mr Bacon 
		said: &#8220;It is worrying that the MoD currently needs to recruit more 
		soldiers, sailors and airmen than it now has deployed in Afghanistan.&nbsp; 
		The level of damage to family life caused by increasing overseas 
		deployment has reached crisis point for many servicemen and women.&nbsp; Our 
		troops do a superb job and it is a sign of failure that the MoD cannot 
		hang on to them&#8221;. </b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>
		&#8220;The MoD 
		must provide stability and certainty for service personnel and their 
		families. Otherwise, an increasing amount of experience, manpower and 
		money will be lost&#8221;.</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">
		The report 
		finds that, at April 2007, the Armed Forces&#8217; overall recruitment 
		shortfall was 5,850 personnel, meaning the MoD currently needs to 
		recruit more people than are currently deployed in Afghanistan.&nbsp; 
		Past cuts in recruitment have had a damaging longer-term effect on 
		manning in some areas, but budget constraints are preventing the MoD 
		from recruiting enough to make up for the shortfall.&nbsp; </p>
