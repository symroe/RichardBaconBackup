<p class="bwp4">Over-optimism on private sector cash
could cost Britain medals in 2012 - MP</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has said that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has over-estimated the amount of private sector funding available for almost every aspect of the 2012 Olympic Games, as a new report finds that the government must raise an additional &pound;100 million from the private sector very quickly, or funding for sports may be cut.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;If British athletes 
  are to deliver a strong performance at the 2012 Olympics, then it is 
  vital that funding is in place now.&nbsp; However, unless the Department for Culture, Media and Sport can 
  raise &pound;100 million of private sector funding by next month, there is 
  a risk that even our brightest sporting hopes may have their funding 
  slashed&#8221;. </b>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;The DCMS was told 
  in 2006 that it needed fundraising expertise, but it only began talks 
  with a fundraising partner in January 2008, only a few months before UK 
  Sport needed the money. It is becoming increasingly clear that almost 
  every aspect of the budget for the 2012 Olympics has over-estimated how 
  much private sector funding is available. There is now a real danger 
  that our athletes may miss out on medals&#8221;. </b> </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon was speaking 
  as the National Audit Office published its report on preparing for 
  sporting success at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The 
  Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is seeking to raise &pound;100 
  million, 17 per cent of its direct funding for sports, from the private 
  sector. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">In 2006, a Commons 
  public accounts committee report concluded that it would be challenging 
  to raise &pound;100 million from the private sector and recommended that the 
  DMCS draw on specialist fundraising expertise. The Department did not 
  begin contract negotiations with sports marketing agency Fast Track 
  until January 2008, as it wanted to secure first-tier sponsors first. UK 
  Sport&#8217;s funding strategy for 2012 is based on starting to receive this 
  additional &pound;100 million funding from April 2008. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">The report finds that 
  there is a risk that, unless the DCMS is successful in raising this 
  money very rapidly, the funding may not be delivered or may become 
  available too late in the Olympic cycle to make a significant difference 
  to the Great Britain teams&#8217; medal chances in 2012. UK Sport has 
  identified a range of options for reducing its funding should a 
  shortfall materialise, all of which would involve cutting funding from 
  those sports which have the lowest medal prospects in 2012. Depending on 
  the severity of any shortfall, UK Sport may also need to cut funding for 
  sports with clear medal prospects.&nbsp; </p>
