		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard 
		Bacon has urged the government to ensure the progress made by academies 
		is not lost once their start-up funding ends, as a new report finds that 
		academies&#8217; financial stability is being put at risk by the withdrawal of 
		their start-up funding and uncertainty over their long-term costs.</p>
		<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
					Commons public accounts committee published its report into 
					the academies programme.&nbsp; 
					Academies are showing signs of progress, with their GCSE 
					performance increasing faster than that of other schools.&nbsp; 
					However, the report finds that it is too early to be certain 
					whether the academies programme will achieve its long term 
					aims. &nbsp;The government does not yet know what the long-term 
					costs of running academies will be, with 17 academies 
					already suffering cost overruns averaging £3.2 million 
					each.&nbsp; The uncertainty over costs, coupled with the 
					withdrawal of up to £1.6 million in start-up funding for 
					each academy, poses risks to academies&#8217; financial stability.</p>
					<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said 
					today: &#8220;It is to soon to be certain that the academies 
					programme will be a success.&nbsp; There are some encouraging 
					signs of progress, but also some worrying signs of drift.&nbsp; 
					The real test will come when academies&#8217; start-up funding 
					comes to an end.&nbsp; The government must keep a close watch to 
					ensure that the progress academies have made is not lost&#8221;.&nbsp;</b><p class="bwp6"><br>
