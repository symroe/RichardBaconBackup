    <!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->
    <p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the National Audit Office report on civil service recruitment, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said: </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The recruitment process for junior civil servants takes too long, costs too much and is sub-standard. Government departments are hiring civil servants to work in tax offices, airports, job centres, prisons and courts but do not pay enough attention to the recruitment process.&#8221; </p>
    <p class="newsbold"> &#8220;Instead of 
      a quick turnaround of Civil Service vacancies with the best 
      applicants, there seems to be general apathy. &nbsp;For example, 
      no data is held centrally on the cost of recruitment 
      programmes.&nbsp; It is typical for a department to have to wait 
      16 weeks for a new member of staff to be appointed.&nbsp; What&#8217;s 
      more, the appointment process costs taxpayers &pound;35 million a 
      year more than it should&#8221;.</p>
    <p class="newsbold"> &#8220;It is 
      these men and women who will be at the sharp end of 
      delivering services to the public.&nbsp; Government departments 
      should take the recruitment of junior civil servants far 
      more seriously&#8221;.</p>
    <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon, a member of the 
      Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the 
      National Audit Office published its report into recruiting 
      civil servants effectively today.&nbsp; 
      In 2007-08, central government recruited more than 40,000 
      new staff, 78 per cent of which took positions at junior 
      grades in a diverse range of areas such as job centres, 
      courts, prisons, airports and tax offices across the UK. &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="newsbody"> The report finds that the 
      costs of staff used in the recruitment process are too high; 
      the length of the recruitment process is too long; and the 
      quality of the recruitment process needs to be improved.&nbsp; 
      Additionally, there is no centrally held data on the cost of 
      central government recruitment programmes and there is the 
      potential to reduce these costs by up to 68 per cent, which 
      could deliver savings in internal staff costs across 
      government of up to &pound;35 million a year without compromising 
      the quality of the candidates appointed. </p>
    <p class="newsbody"> The report also finds that, 
      within central government, it can typically take 16 weeks to 
      recruit a new member of staff. </p>
