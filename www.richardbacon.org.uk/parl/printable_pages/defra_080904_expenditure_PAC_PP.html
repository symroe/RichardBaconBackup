<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard 
  Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, has said that 
  the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)has a 
  &#8216;casual approach&#8217; to the use of public money, as a report finds 
  financial management failings at the Department.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;It is common sense that if you keep spending 
  more than you have, you will get into financial trouble. This doesn&#8217;t 
  appear to have occurred to Defra, which blew its &pound;3.6 billion budget two 
  years running&#8221;. </b>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Sound financial management was just 
          not a priority for those running the Department. The Treasury quite 
          rightly says it is important to maintain sound public finances. 
          However, Defra&#8217;s management board was simply not willing or able to 
          tackle budgetary problems&#8221;.<br>
              <br>
  &#8220;Taxpayers have a right to expect value for money but this will be 
          impossible while departments like Defra have such a casual approach 
          to public funds&#8221;.<br>
          </b><br>
          Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee 
          published its report on the management of expenditure by the 
          Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). </p>
        <p class="newsbody">In 2007-08, the Department received &pound;3.6 billion 
          from the Treasury, but failed to allocate final budgets to each of 
          its business areas until five months into the financial year. This 
          was because Defra&#8217;s planned expenditure was in excess of funds 
          provided and budget holders did not immediately declare all their 
          financial commitments. Additionally, severe flooding and animal 
          disease outbreaks in 2007 added further unforeseen costs. A similar 
          situation arose in 2006&#8211;07, forcing Defra to make &pound;170 million worth 
          of cuts. <br>
              <br>
          The report finds that Defra&#8217;s financial management failings arose 
          largely from unwillingness within the Department&#8217;s management board 
          to tackle budgetary problems and a failure to instil a culture of 
          tight financial management throughout the organisation.</p>
