<blockquote><span class="newsbold">&ldquo;Ken Clarke  will need to take off his hush puppies and put some heavy boots on to sort this  one out.&rdquo;</span><br>
  <span class="newsbody"><em>Richard  Bacon MP</em></span></blockquote>
<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the  disqualification by the National Audit Office (NAO) of the HM Courts Service  accounts, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a Conservative member of the public  accounts committee, said: </p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;This is a  disgraceful position for the Courts Service to have reached.&nbsp; It is true  that the Libra computer system is both expensive and useless but we have known  this for many years (</strong><em>see  here: <a href="http://www.richardbacon.org.uk/parl/libra2.htm" class="tsb">Cost of Courts' IT system  triples</a>) <strong></em>and public bodies still have a duty  to keep proper records. We are now looking at a possible &pound;1.4 billion loss in  uncollected fines and penalties partly because of the longstanding shambles  that passes for record-keeping in the courts service.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;For  centuries, people have kept accurate records and accounts using pen and paper.  This could still be done now if needed and if there were sufficient will to do  it.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>Disqualification  is the auditor&rsquo;s nuclear button. It is far, far worse than a qualified opinion  by the auditor on some aspect of the accounts.&nbsp; The NAO is saying that the  Courts Service cannot produce the most basic information which the auditors need  to do their job.&rdquo;</strong> </p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Ken Clarke will need to  take off his hush puppies and put some heavy boots on to sort this one out.&rdquo;</strong></p>
