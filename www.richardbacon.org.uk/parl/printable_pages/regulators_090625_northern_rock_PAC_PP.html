<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">National Audit Office 
needs total access to Financial Services Authority, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody">COMMENTING ON the publication of the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report 
  into the nationalisation of Northern Rock, South Norfolk MP Richard 
  Bacon, a member of the committee, said: 
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none; text-align:justify"> <b> &#8220;As head of the National Audit Office (NAO), the Comptroller 
  and Auditor General is Parliament&#8217;s financial watchdog and he can audit 
  any government department at any time he chooses.&nbsp; However, when it comes to the work of the Financial Services 
  Authority the Comptroller and Auditor General and NAO must currently wait 
  for an invitation.&#8221;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></b>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;If the NAO had been able 
  entirely at its own discretion to undertake studies of any aspect of the 
  work of the Financial Services Authority, then the weaknesses in the 
  Tripartite regulatory arrangement between the Treasury, the Bank of England 
  and the Financial Services Authority would almost certainly have been 
  identified much earlier.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;In these circumstances, it 
		  is also likely that the problems at Northern Rock would have been identified 
		  sooner.&nbsp; In the event, once the bank went bust the Tripartite Authorities 
		  found themselves totally out of their depth.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;The National Audit Office 
		  is one of the world&#8217;s leading supreme audit institutions and it is absurd 
		  that such a body should not have total unfettered access to a regulator such 
		  as the Financial Services Authority in order to audit any aspect of the 
		  FSA&#8217;s work.&#8221;</span></font></b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public 
		  accounts committee published its report into the nationalisation of Northern 
		  Rock.&nbsp; The Comptroller and Auditor General 
		  (C&amp;AG), who is an officer of the House of Commons and the head of the 
		  National Audit Office, has a statutory remit to audit the accounts of all 
		  government departments and agencies as well as a wide range of other public 
		  bodies, and reports to Parliament on the economy, efficiency and 
		  effectiveness with which these bodies have used public money.&nbsp; The current 
		  C&amp;AG is Mr Amyas Morse.&nbsp; The report finds that the C&amp;AG has not been able to 
		  report on the regulatory activities of the Financial Services Authority (FSA).&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> The FSA currently lies outside his statutory remit although he may undertake 
		  an audit if invited to do so by the Treasury. Since the FSA was established 
		  in 2000, the C&amp;AG has only been asked to report on the work of the FSA once, 
		  and then only within a narrow remit defined by the Treasury and the 
		  Authority. The FSA is a company limited by guarantee and is funded by a levy 
		  on the financial services industry. </span></font></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> The C&amp;AG already has power to report on the 
		  work of other regulators funded by industry levies, such as Ofgem and 
		  Postwatch, and has been able to audit companies limited by guarantee since 
		  2007. </span></font></p>
