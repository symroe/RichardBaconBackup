with dignity&#8217;, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on </span>the Commons 
  public accounts committee&#8217;s report on end of life care, South 
  Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Given the choice, most people would prefer to 
  spend their final days at home, surrounded by the ones they love.</p>
    <p class="newsbold">&#8220;However, 58 per cent of us end 
      our lives on a hospital ward, regardless of whether or not we need 
      to be there.&nbsp; Death is one of the few things that we all share but 
      also one of the things we try hardest to avoid discussing, but we 
      must not let our squeamishness about death deter us from making sure 
      that people can die without pain and with the dignity and respect 
      they deserve.</p>
    <p class="newsbold">&#8220;Unfortunately, it 
      appears that Primary Care Trusts are as reluctant to talk about 
      death as the rest of us.&nbsp; This has led to patients&#8217; wishes not 
      always being communicated effectively and a lack of basic training 
      in end of life care for health and social care staff.&nbsp; This needs to 
      be put right, because nobody deserves to spend their last days stuck 
      needlessly on a hospital ward because of a bureaucratic logjam.</p>
    <p class="newsbold">&#8220;70 per cent of 
      independent hospices are on pathetically short NHS contracts and, 
      for 97 per cent of hospices, the funding they receive doesn&#8217;t cover 
      the services they are expected to provide.&nbsp; This is just wrong.&nbsp; The 
      NHS should not short-change hospices but should give them the funds 
      they need to continue to provide first-class end of life care.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons 
      public accounts committee, was speaking as the committee published 
      its report on end of life care.&nbsp; End of 
      life care services seek to support those with advanced, progressive, 
      incurable illness to live as well as possible until they die.&nbsp; 
      People approaching the end of their life often require a complex mix 
      of health and social care services provided in hospitals, care 
      homes, hospices and their own home. </p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> The report finds that most people 
      would prefer not to die in hospital but in 2006, only 35 per cent&nbsp; 
      of people died at home or in a care home and 58 per cent of deaths 
      occurred in an acute hospital, ranging from 46 per cent to 77 per 
      cent across Primary Care Trusts.&nbsp; A lack of NHS and social care 
      support services means that many people die in hospital so when 
      there is no clinical need for them to be there. There is also a lack 
      of training in basic end of life care amongst frontline staff, many 
      of whom will at some stage come into contact with people nearing the 
      end of their life.</p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> The voluntary sector has made, and 
      continues to make, a huge contribution to end of life care.&nbsp; Some 70 
      per cent of independent hospices, however, have contracts with 
      Primary Care Trusts for one year only and, in 2006&#8211;07, the funding 
      received from the NHS by 97 per cent of independent hospices did not 
      fully cover the costs of the NHS services they provided, or the cost 
      of relevant overheads.&nbsp; By May 2008, only 56 per cent had agreed 
      funding for 2008&#8211;09.&nbsp; Such contractual arrangements leave hospices 
      with no firm, long-term base for developing and expanding their 
      operations.</p>
