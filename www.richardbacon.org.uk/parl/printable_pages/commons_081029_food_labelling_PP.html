<p class="bigword4">MP seeks better country-of-origin labelling for food</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has renewed his 
  attempt to change the law on food labelling to require clear 
  country of origin labelling on food.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon, who first sought to 
  change the law on food labelling in 2004, obtained the agreement 
  of the House of Commons to introduce a Food Labelling Bill, 
  which would create a mandatory regime for labelling the country 
  of origin of food products sold to consumers.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Speaking 
  in the House of Commons, Mr Bacon said: &#8220;Consumers should 
  have the information they need to make informed decisions about 
  the food they buy.&nbsp; There is a wide range of issues which may 
  quite rightly be of concern to them in making their purchasing 
  decisions.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top"> &#8220;These include the nutritional and calorific value of 
  food, the salt or fat content, the animal welfare standards 
  under which food is produced, and the country of origin.&nbsp; Any 
  food labelling regime must seek to address these various 
  concerns.</p>
<p class="newsbold" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top"> &#8220;It is important that all food producers adhere to the 
  same high standards for food labelling and the best way to 
  achieve this is through a statutory framework.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Clear 
  mandatory country of origin labelling would significantly reduce 
  the risk that consumers making a food purchasing decision should 
  be misled or in practice be unable to use their consumer power 
  to support domestic producers, if that is what they wish to do&#8221;. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was 
  speaking after the launch of the film, <i>An Inconvenient Trough</i>, made by a 
  group of pig farmers. &nbsp;The film draws attention to the 
  conditions facing pig farmers, notably that 70 per cent of the 
  imports of pork and pork products into the United Kingdom are 
  produced to animal welfare standards that would unlawful in this 
  country.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon 
  added: &#8220;It is in 
  this context that we must look at country of origin labelling. I 
  must emphasise that this is not in order to prevent consumers 
  from buying products from where they wish, but rather to ensure 
  that they are making informed decisions and that they cannot be 
  misled.</p>
<p class="newsbold" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top"> &#8220;I make no secret 
  of the fact that I wish all consumers would buy British meat all 
  the time. But achieving this is a matter for consumers and it is 
  not the purpose of my Bill.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;I would just like to 
  see a fair deal for British farmers and to ensure they are given 
  the chance to compete fairly with overseas products; that the 
  lower animal welfare standards often applied to imported 
  production are clearly marked for consumers as well as the 
  higher standards of domestic production; and that farmers are 
  able to engage the consumer in supporting the high standards of 
  food safety, animal welfare and environmental care that lie at 
  the heart of British farming and cannot be undermined by 
  misleading labelling of competing products. </b></p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;A vital part of facilitating this shift in priorities would be 
  to ensure that this country has far more rigorous and 
  transparent food labelling&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
