MP calls on county to boost bus services</b></div>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has written to transport bosses at County Hall and asked about their plans to boost bus use in Norfolk, after a new report has found that bus passenger numbers across England are declining outside London.
<p class="newsbody">Mr 
  Bacon took action after the National Audit Office (NAO) and the Audit 
  Commission issued a joint report into how 
  bus services are delivered. </p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">The report finds that continuing growth in bus use in London alone will lead to a 12 per cent increase in passenger numbers in the next five years, but that the use of buses outside the capital is declining. The report urges local authorities to look again at how they provide bus services and to increase the stability of timetables and routes.
  <p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;There is much that 
    local authorities and bus companies could do to increase the use of 
    buses.&nbsp; For example, some constituents of mine on an evening out 
    discovered a late-night bus service running from Norwich to South 
    Norfolk, but found there was no timetable for the service available on 
    the bus itself.&nbsp; Such a simple, low cost measure could go a long way to 
    lifting passenger numbers.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbold">&ldquo;When compared to 
    the cost and convenience of driving, especially in a rural area, buses 
    are becoming less and less attractive.&nbsp; We need to look again at whether 
    rural bus services are being delivered in the most efficient, cost 
    effective and socially inclusive way possible.&nbsp; I urge officials at 
    County Hall to consider the advice in this report very seriously&rdquo;</b>.</p>
