<h3>&pound;&frac14; billion at risk on &lsquo;free ride&rsquo; contracts, MP warns</h3>
  <p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on </span>the publication of the Commons public accounts committee report on the government&#8217;s management of service contracts, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said: 
  <p class="newsbody"> <b>&#8220;Last year, the government spent nearly a quarter of a 
    billion pounds on managing contracts for services such as 
    computers, security, cleaning and catering.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Sadly, the moment the ink on the 
    contracts was dry, the government appears to have lost interest in 
    doing the job properly.</b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>&#8220;This 
    report reveals a litany of cut corners and complacency.&nbsp; 
    Some 41 per cent of contract managers did not check to see 
    if new services were providing taxpayers with value for 
    money, while over half the contracts did not have a &#8216;Plan B&#8217; 
    in case of supplier failure.</b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>&#8220;A good contract should include 
    both sticks and carrots in order to encourage suppliers to 
    improve their game, but only a third of contracts had the 
    &#8216;carrot&#8217; of financial incentives and 38 per cent of contract 
    managers failed to use the &#8216;stick&#8217; of financial penalties.&nbsp; </b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>&#8220;Taxpayers 
    do not expect the government to give under-performing 
    suppliers a free ride at their expense, especially not in 
    the current economic climate. &nbsp;If the government is serious 
    about cutting back waste, then it needs to wake up and start 
    paying attention to the proper management of service 
    contracts.&#8221;</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
    Commons public accounts committee published its report on 
    the government&#8217;s management of service contracts.&nbsp; In 2007-08 the government spent 
    &pound;12 billion, primarily in the areas of IT and 
    communications, facilities management and business process 
    outsourcing and an estimated &pound;240 million on managing these 
    contracts.</p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">The report finds that 41 per 
    cent of contract managers had not tested the value for money 
    of new services purchased under an existing contract.&nbsp; There 
    was no documented plan for managing 28 per cent of contracts 
    and 56 per cent of contracts did not have a contingency plan 
    in case of supplier failure.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">The report also finds good 
    contract management should include financial incentives to 
    encourage suppliers to improve performance.&nbsp; However, over a 
    third of contracts surveyed by the National Audit Office had 
    no provision for such incentives and that 38 per cent of 
    contract managers do not always apply financial penalties 
    where suppliers under-performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
