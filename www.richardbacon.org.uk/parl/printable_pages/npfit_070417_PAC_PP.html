<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">NAO report shows continuing crisis in &pound;13 billion NHS IT programme</p>
		<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">SOUTH NORFOLK</span> MP Richard Bacon said today that the health service would be better off without Connecting for Health, the Department of Health agency responsible for the national programme for IT in the NHS.</p>
        <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published a 
          damning report on the multi-billion pound programme which concludes that &#8220;at the 
          present rate of progress it is unlikely that significant clinical benefits will 
          be delivered by the end of the contract period&#8221;.</p>
        <p class="newsbody">He has called for the agency to be wound up, with 
          most of its budget handed over to local hospital bosses and any 
          remaining functions handled by the Department of Health. </p>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon, a member of the 
          committee, said: &#8220;Connecting for Health has produced exceptional anger and 
          frustration among doctors, nurses, and hospital managers. It is a nightmare 
          organisation and I think the NHS would be better off without it&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The bulk of the programme 
          should be handled by local hospital chief executives in consultation with 
          their own clinicians, who all have a direct interest in delivering IT that 
          works. Local hospitals should have freedom to buy from a wide range of 
          suppliers whose technology conforms to national standards. Functions such as 
          setting common standards could be transferred to the Department of Health. 
          There is no need for an expensive separate agency&#8221;.</b></p>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This is a truly grim tale. 
          The NHS IT programme has already cost over &pound;2 billion, with five times more 
          than that in the pipeline, and yet the programme is unlikely to deliver 
          significant clinical benefits by the end of the contract.&nbsp; There have been 
          six bosses in five years.&nbsp; The programme has left doctors, nurses and 
          hospital managers spitting with rage.&nbsp; Most GPs think the appointment 
          booking system is a joke.&nbsp; And three fifths of the programme is dependent on 
          a software supplier, iSoft, which is under investigation by the Financial 
          Services Authority and whose flagship software product, &#8216;Lorenzo&#8217;, does not 
          yet exist even though the company said it was available three years ago, and 
          which in the meantime has been merrily selling old software which pre-dates 
          the national programme. You just couldn&#8217;t make this up&#8221;.</b></p>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&nbsp;&#8220;The limited deployment of 
          administrative systems which has taken place so far has caused havoc in 
          various hospitals, leading to significant delays in providing inoculations 
          to children, waiting list breaches, missing patient records, extended shut 
          downs of some systems and the inability to report activity statistics&#8221;. </b></p>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The central problem arises 
          from a set of huge contracts which were signed in great haste, before either 
          the government had understood properly what it wanted to buy or the 
          suppliers had understood what it was they were expected to supply.&nbsp; It is 
          impossible to avoid the conclusion that this project has been an expensive 
          failure. It will continue to fail unless there are drastic changes&#8221;.</b></p>
        <p class="newsbody">The report calls on the 
          Department of Health to commission and publish an independent assessment of 
          the business case for the Programme in the light of the progress and 
          experience to date. </p>
        <p class="newsbody">In view of the slippage in 
          the deployment of local systems, the MPs also recommend that the Department 
          of Health should commission an urgent independent review of the performance 
          of Local Service Providers against their contractual obligations.</p>

              late with no published dates for its completion; and concludes that the 
              implementation of phases 2 and 3, which are the key to the delivery of 
              clinical benefits and which were the core of the business case for the 
              
              high cost contracts, may scarcely have begun by the time the Local

              patient administration systems (PAS) as the essential first step in the 
              introduction of the local Care Record Service. As of June 2006 the 
              actual number was 13 hospitals. In June 2006 the Department wrote to us 
              stating that by October 2006 there would be a further twenty-two. So far 
              as we are aware, up to the end of February 2007 the number has increased 
              by only five acute hospitals. The introduction of clinical as opposed to 
              administrative software has scarcely begun; indeed, essential clinical

              some 13 acute Trusts had had their Patient Administration System (PAS) 
              replaced, which itself provides no care record functionality beyond what 
              they already had. In those regions where iSOFT is the main software 
              supplier, the replacement has been an old iSOFT PAS which pre-dates the 
              Programme because the PAS element of the new system, Lorenzo&#8212;which is 
              being developed for the Programme and which the company stated was 
              available from early 2004 &#8212; is not yet available. <b> <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">PAC REPORT PAGE 13, PARAGRAPH 10.</span></b> <br>
