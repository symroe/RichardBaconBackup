</div>	
	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>South Norfolk MP Richard 
	Bacon has asked the National Audit Office (NAO) to investigate reports that 
	a new care records system could be putting patient safety at risk.</b></p>
	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon has written to Sir 
	John Bourn, Comptroller and Auditor General and head of the NAO, asking him 
	to examine the use of a new care records system at the Nuffield Orthopaedic 
	Centre in Oxford, after the Nuffield was obliged to file a &#8220;serious untoward 
	incident&#8221; report when the system went live. Examples of serious untoward 
	incidents include events which have or may have caused death, serious 
	injury, or are life-threatening, or contributed to a pattern of reduced 
	standard of care, or caused serious disruption to services. </p>
	<p class="newsbody">Although Nuffield executives say that patient safety has 
	not been affected, internal papers at the Trust identify &#8220;major issues of 
	patient safety&#8221; such as patients being &#8220;lost in the system&#8221;.</p>
	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">The patient care records 
	system is part of a controversial national programme for IT in the health 
	service known as Connecting for Health, which &#8211; when rolled out nationally &#8211; 
	will allow 50 million electronic patient records to be shared across 
	England. The National Audit Office is undertaking a wide-ranging study into 
	Connecting for Health, which is the world&#8217;s largest civilian IT programme.
	</p>
	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the 
	Commons public accounts committee, said: <b>&nbsp;</b></p>
	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;Connecting for Health 
	has many of the hallmarks of a classic IT fiasco. It is being foisted on 
	clinicians with no proper consultation and there is over-rapid 
	implementation without proper testing.&nbsp; Now we are seeing reports that it is 
	potentially compromising patient safety. Since the NAO is already 
	undertaking a study of Connecting for Health, it should also examine these 
	incidents at the Nuffield&#8221;.</b></p>
