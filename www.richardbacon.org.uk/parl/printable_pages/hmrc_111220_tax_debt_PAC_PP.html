  <span class="newsbody"><em>Richard Bacon MP</em></span></blockquote>
<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the Commons  public accounts committee&rsquo;s report on HM Revenue &amp; Customs&rsquo; handling of tax  disputes, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Committee, said:</p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;HM Revenue &amp; Customs has  succeeded in creating the impression that it takes a softer approach to large  and powerful firms while being tougher on small businesses.&nbsp; Whether  accurate or not, this notion is toxic for HMRC&rsquo;s relationship with the vast  majority of taxpayers.&nbsp; If all taxpayers are to have confidence that they  are being treated even-handedly, HMRC must ensure that its dealings with large  corporations are not&nbsp;just beyond reproach, but seen to be beyond reproach.  Everyone is equal before the law. The same rules and fair treatment must apply  - and be seen to apply - to everyone.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;HMRC has failed to follow  its own processes for settling some large tax cases, in one instance resulting  in a loss of interest payable that could potentially be as high as &pound;20  million.&nbsp; While there is a need for confidentiality to protect individual  taxpayers, this should not be used as a cloak to avoid scrutiny.&nbsp; HMRC  officials have refused to answer legitimate questions about HMRC&rsquo;s handling of  tax cases, despite their clear duty to assist Parliament in establishing that  HMRC&rsquo;s work provides taxpayers with value for money.&nbsp; It is troubling that  it was necessary to compel an HMRC official to give evidence under Oath because  MPs could not get straight answers to their questions&rdquo;.</p>
