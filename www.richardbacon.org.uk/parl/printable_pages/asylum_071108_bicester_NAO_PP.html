<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform:uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has calculated that the money which the Home Office has written off after scrapping plans for ten asylum centres across the UK could have put more than 1,300 new police officers on the beat.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office published its report into the cancellation of the Bicester asylum centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p class="newsbody">The Home Office spent &pound;28 million on plans to build an asylum centre in Bicester, 
  Oxfordshire, the first of ten such purpose-built asylum centres in 
  Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the face significant local opposition 
  as well as faster processing of asylum applications and a drop in the 
  number of people claiming asylum in the UK, the programme was cancelled 
  in June 2005.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">The programme cost 
    &pound;33.7 million, of which &pound;28 million was spent on planning the Bicester 
    asylum centre.&nbsp; Following the cancellation of the scheme, the Home 
    Office recorded a &pound;29.1 million loss in its financial statements.&nbsp; This 
    loss would be enough to pay for over 1,300 new police officers, or 30 
    officers each for every police force in England and Wales.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>Mr Bacon said: 
    &#8220;The amount the Home Office has written off could have put over 1,300 
    police officers on the beat across England and Wales.&nbsp; Instead, the 
    money was squandered in traditional Home Office fashion.&nbsp; The sad truth 
    is no-one will be shocked that the Home Office has spent millions of 
    pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money yet has absolutely nothing to show for it&#8221;.</b></p>
