<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">NHS complaints body to face probe</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has described the Healthcare Commission as &#8220;a mess&#8221;, after the head of the National Audit Office wrote to the MP confirming that the audit body is planning a study of the Commission&#8217;s poor performance.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt">The Healthcare Commission was established in July 2004 to deal with unresolved 
  complaints against the NHS, and estimated the volume of complaints it would face 
  at between 3,500 and 5,000 review requests per year.&nbsp; However, in its first two 
  years the Commission actually received 15,460 requests, more than double its 
  best-case estimate and more than 50 per cent higher than even its worst-case 
  scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt; "> In September Mr Bacon wrote to Sir John Bourn, head of the National Audit Office (NAO), raising concerns over whether the Healthcare Commission, which receives &pound;69 million from taxpayers, was delivering value for money. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt; "> In replying to Mr Bacon, Sir John Bourn refers to widespread concerns about the Healthcare Commission and states that the NAO has received approaches from members of the public about the handling of individual complaints against the NHS and, in particular, the Healthcare Commission&#8217;s performance in carrying out second stage independent reviews. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt; "> Sir John states that these concerns have prompted the NAO to start the scoping work for a study of the NHS complaints process, including the Commission&#8217;s role within it. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt; "> <b>Mr Bacon said today:  &#8220;The Healthcare Commission is in a mess and is neither value for money for the complainant nor the complained against.  It is not dealing with the number of complaints that are inevitably coming its way, partly because its estimated workload appears to have been calculated on the back of an envelope&#8221;. </b> </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt; "> <b>&#8220;Many complaints are simply not being dealt with adequately, which causes delay, distress and distrust.  Patients deserve better and I am pleased the NAO is taking steps to investigate this chaos&#8221;. </b> </p>
