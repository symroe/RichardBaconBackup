<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on </span>the 
  publication of the Commons public accounts committee report on 
  how the Department for Work and Pensions handles complaints, 
  South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Jobcentre Plus and the Pensions, Disability and Carers Service are executive agencies of the Department for Work and Pensions.  In 2007-08, these agencies recorded 70,000 complaints about their services.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The trouble is that these two agencies only recorded a fifth of the complaints that customers say they made.</b>
<p class="newsbody"> <b>&#8220;These unrecorded complaints may have been addressed quickly and easily, but they could also have provided an early warning of poor service, communications failures or more serious problems ahead.  By not recording complaints properly, the Department may well be missing the bigger picture and it should take steps to sort this out.&#8221;</b>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
  Commons public accounts committee published its report on 
  how the Department for Work and Pensions handles complaints.&nbsp; Jobcentre Plus and the 
  Pensions, Disability and Carers Service are executive 
  agencies of the Department for Work and Pensions. In 
  2007&#8211;08, they provided services to over 22 million customers 
  and around 70,000 complaints were recorded by the agencies.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The number of customers who 
  say they have complained is about five times the number of 
  complaints recorded by the Department. This outcome may 
  reflect low-level complaints which are resolved quickly and 
  go unrecorded as a result but the Department has no 
  consistent system across its operations for recording 
  complaints.&nbsp; The Department is planning to research why 
  under-recording is occurring and it is currently piloting a 
  simplified system of recording complaints with the intention 
  of moving to a common system.</p>
