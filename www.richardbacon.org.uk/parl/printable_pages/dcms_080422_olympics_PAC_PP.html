  says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt">SOUTH NORFOLK MP 
  Richard Bacon has said that the original budget for the 2012 Olympic 
  and Paralympic Games now looks like &#8216;smoke and mirrors&#8217;, as a 
  new report finds that the budget for the Games has risen by over &pound;5 
  billion since London&#8217;s successful bid.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;The original budget for the 2012 
  Olympics now looks like smoke and mirrors.&nbsp; Funding from the 
  private sector was left in the budget, despite the fact that DCMS 
  didn&#8217;t know where that money was coming from&#8221;.</b>
<p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;Meanwhile, entirely foreseeable costs such as tax and security 
  were left out.&nbsp; Taxpayers will now be taking g DCMS&#8217; pledge not to exceed 
  the revised &pound;9.3 billion budget with a pinch of salt&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;If the public are to have confidence in the government&#8217;s ability to 
  deliver the 2012 Olympic Games, ministers must be open and honest about 
  the Olympic budget and reassure taxpayers that the Games are fully 
  costed&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"> Mr. Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee 
  published its report on the budget for the London 2012 Olympic and 
  Paralympic Games.&nbsp; 
  At the 
  time of London&#8217;s bid to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the 
  budget for the Games stood at just over &pound;4 billion, comprising &pound;3.4 
  billion of taxpayers&#8217; money with a further &pound;738 million from the private 
  sector.&nbsp; However, in March 2007, the
  
  Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced a revised 
  budget of &pound;9.3 billion, an increase of over &pound;5 billion.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"> The report finds that while the costs of tax and security were excluded 
  from the estimates since they were uncertain, &pound;738 million of funding 
  from the private sector was included despite its not being supported by 
  robust analysis. </p>
