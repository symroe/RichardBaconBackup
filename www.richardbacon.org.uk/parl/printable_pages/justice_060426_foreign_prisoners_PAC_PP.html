<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"><b>Richard Bacon MP has forced the Home Office to own up to blunders which have allowed foreign killers and rapists to stay in Britain when they leave prison. </b>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">1,023 criminals who are foreign nationals have been let out prison without being deported, including people convicted of murder, rape and arson. The startling facts emerged in a Home Office statement released following persistent questioning from South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon.
<p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon was following up on questions he had asked as part of an enquiry by the Commons public accounts committee, of which he is a member. The Home Office statement showed that 1,023 criminals who are foreign nationals have been let out prison since February 1999 without being deported. This group included 3 murderers, 9 rapists, and 39 people convicted of indecent assault or other sexual offences including 5 sexual offences involving minors. Others included 62 drug dealers, 41 burglars, 4 arsonists, 4 guilty of kidnapping and 93 who were sent to prison for robbery.
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;It is beyond belief that the Home Office simply 
  allowed foreign prisoners who were guilty of the most serious crimes 
  to leave jail without even asking if they should now be deported&#8221;. &nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;Foreign nationals 
  who come here are guests in this country. If they abuse our 
  hospitality by committing serious crimes there should be a 
  presumption that they will face deportation when they leave prison, 
  instead of which the Home Office just let them walk out.&nbsp; The Home 
  Office has been guilty of a complete dereliction of duty&#8221;.</b></p>
