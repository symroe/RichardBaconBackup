<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Bring flood defences up to scratch, 
urges MP </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span> MP Richard Bacon has called on the Environment Agency to improve flood defences in areas which are at high risk of flooding, as a new report finds that the general condition of flood defence assets has not significantly improved since 2001. </p>
<p class="newsbold" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"> Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;Flooding can do massive damage to homes and businesses, and the costs of clearing up afterwards can be huge.</p>
<p class="newsbold"> &ldquo;It is worrying that fewer than half of flood defences are at their target 
  condition, meaning we simply do not know whether they could withstand a 
  serious flood. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The Environment Agency should not be taking 
  risks with peoples&#8217; lives and property and it must focus on bringing 
  flood defences in high risk areas up to scratch as soon as possible&#8221;.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office 
  (NAO) published its report on river and coastal flood defences.&nbsp; The report finds that only 57 per cent of all     flood risk asset systems, and 46 per cent of high risk systems, such as 
  those protecting urban areas, were up to standard by March 2007, with 
  potential risks should a flood occur. </p>
<p class="bigword6">The Picture in Norfolk</p>
<p class="newsbody">Norfolk comes under the Environment Agency&#8217;s 
  Anglian Region, which covers more than 27,000 square kilometres from the 
  Thames Estuary in the south to Humber Estuary in the North and as far 
  inland as Northampton.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The report looks at the Kelling to Lowestoft Ness 
  Shoreline Management Plan, in which the Environment Agency states that 
  &#8216;managed realignment&#8217;, or no active intervention on the coastline, is 
  the only appropriate long-term solution to coastal erosion.&nbsp; This 
  scheme, if implemented, would allow the monitored retreat of the 
  shoreline, with consequent disruption to affected communities.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon added: &#8220;I am greatly concerned by the 
  Environment Agency&#8217;s plans to give up the Norfolk shoreline.&nbsp; Great 
  Britain is a relatively small island and I do not believe we should just 
  surrender to the sea&#8221;.</p>
