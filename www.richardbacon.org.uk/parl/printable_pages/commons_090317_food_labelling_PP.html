<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">MP calls for honest food labelling to be made compulsory</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has launched his latest
  attempt to change the law on food labelling to require clear 
  country of origin labelling on food. </p>
<p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon, who sought to change the law on food labelling in 2004
  and again in 2008, obtained the agreement of the House of Commons to 
  introduce bill which would call for compulsory country of origin 
  labelling for meat and meat products. 
<p class="newsbold">Speaking 
  in the House of Commons, Mr Bacon said: &#8220;There is no shortage of agreement that there is a problem.  The question is what we do about it.  My conclusion is that the time has come for honest food labelling to be made compulsory. </b> </p>
    <p class="newsbold" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top"> &#8220;Some people say that legislation on country of origin would amount to a restriction on free trade.  I think is simply to misunderstand what consumer choice is all about.  It is very hard to see how providing consumers with clear and unambiguous information about where their food comes from could possibly be construed as protectionist. </p>
    <p class="newsbold" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top"> &#8220;More fully informed consumers do not protect particular market participants or hinder the operation of a marketplace &#8211; they make it work better. </p>
    <p class="newsbold" style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top"> &#8220;Some consumers wish precisely to exercise their choices based on the origins of food.  During the Apartheid era, many people who found Apartheid abhorrent wished quite understandably to avoid buying fruit from South Africa in order to show their disapproval of that regime. Nowadays, some people wish to know the origins of food to support high animal welfare standards or low food miles.&#8221; </p>
    <p class="newsbold">&#8220;The call for country of origin food labelling is being supported by a wide cross-section of the farming, agricultural and animal welfare community.&#8221;
      
      
      
      &#8220;We have been waiting for years for a workable voluntary scheme for country of origin food labelling.  The time has come to accept that honest food labelling requires the force of law. That is what consumers have the right to expect and that is what my Bill provides.&#8221; </p>
