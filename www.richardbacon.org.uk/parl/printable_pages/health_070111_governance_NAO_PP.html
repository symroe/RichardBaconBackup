    <!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->
    <p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has said there is a danger of the NHS losing its focus in the face of continual restructuring, as a new report warns primary care trusts not to let organisational changes in the NHS obstruct quality and safety in patient care. <br>
        <br>
      Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report on the implementation of clinical governance in primary care. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Clinical governance is the framework which makes the NHS accountable 
      for its services and which safeguards the highest standards of 
      clinical care. The NAO report finds that, for clinical governance to 
      deliver sustained benefits to patients, the NHS must ensure quality 
      and safety remain at the heart of the health agenda in the face of 
      major changes to the way primary care services are delivered to 
      patients.</p>
    <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public 
      accounts committee, said today:</p>
    <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The NHS is almost constantly being reformed 
      and restructured, most recently by cutting the number of strategic 
      health authorities from 28 to 10 and halving the number of primary 
      care trusts from 303 to 152, as part of the government&#8217;s NHS reform 
      agenda&#8221;.</b></p>
    <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;It would be only too easy for the NHS to 
      lose focus.&nbsp; Patient care and safety should come first and ministers 
      must ensure that trusts do not lose sight of the importance of 
      safety and quality in patient care, and that clinical governance 
      does not suffer because of the near-constant reorganisation of 
      primary care&#8221;.</b></p>
