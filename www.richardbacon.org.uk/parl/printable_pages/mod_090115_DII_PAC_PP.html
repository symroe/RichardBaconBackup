personal details of 1.7 million people</span></p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase">Following questions </span>from South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, the Ministry of Defence has admitted losing personal details of 1.7 million recruits and potential recruits. The data was lost from a portable hard disk at the offices of computer company EDS in Hook, Hampshire. 
<p class="newsbody" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt">Details of the loss are contained in a schedule of &#8216;Incidents leading to the loss or potential compromise of personal data&#8217; provided to Mr Bacon following his questions at the public accounts committee hearing on the Defence Information Infrastructure project, on which the PAC has published a report. </p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;Recruitment data seems to be handled with an extraordinary lack of care. Data on recruits has been lost on at least 6 occasions in less than 5 years, including on four occasions from cars outside private residences. In this latest incident, a portable hard disk containing data on 1.7 million recruits and potential recruits was lost from EDS at Hook in Hampshire. The MoD state that their police force are now investigating this incident but it would be much better not to lose the data in the first place&#8221;. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Another incident involved the theft of a laptop from the Army Foundation College in Harrogate which had been used for making local passes for junior soldiers. This is a very worrying breach of security&#8221;. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;On two occasions, in February 2008 and May 2008, laptops or memory sticks containing Army personnel data were lost in night clubs. The MoD needs to explain why some of its staff think it is appropriate for information on serving soldiers to be loaded on to privately-owned laptops or memory sticks and then taken into nightclubs.&#8221; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;If the MoD had managed to lose the personal details of military top brass, senior civil servants or ministers, then it is unlikely that its &#8216;Lose data? Find it later&#8217; attitude would have persisted for so long.&#8221; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2008, the Ministry of Defence managed to lose 747 laptops <em>(see paragraph 28, page Ev 21 of the report)</em>. That is equivalent to three laptops lost each week, every week, for four years.&#8221; </p>
