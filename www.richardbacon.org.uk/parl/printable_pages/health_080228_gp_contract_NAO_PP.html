<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
  Bacon has said that GPs are not to blame if the Department of Health got 
  its sums wrong when estimating the cost of the new GP contract.&nbsp; 
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The GP contract cost &pound;1.76 billion more than expected, largely because the Department of Health used an unpiloted scheme which underestimated how much work GPs actually did.&nbsp; The BMA warned the Department that its estimates of GPs&#8217; work were too low but they were ignored.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;GPs are not to blame if the Department of 
  Health didn&#8217;t do its sums properly, and any future changes to the GP 
  contract must be fully funded and piloted properly&#8221;.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, was speaking as 
  the National Audit Office published its report on the GP contract.&nbsp; The new contract for 
  general practice has cost the Department of Health &pound;1.76 billion 
  more than it originally budgeted for.&nbsp; The largest overspend of the contract 
  was due to an underestimation of the amount that GPs would earn from 
  the pay for performance scheme, the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">However, practices scored much more highly on 
  the framework than the Department had predicted i.e. 91 per cent 
  against estimates of 75 per cent.&nbsp; The British Medical Association 
  (BMA) told the National Audit Office that it had warned the 
  Department of Health that their estimates were too low, but there is 
  evidence that the Department chose to ignore them.&nbsp; Additionally, 
  the QOF was not piloted before it was introduced, so the Department 
  had limited information on which to base its estimates.&nbsp; </p>
