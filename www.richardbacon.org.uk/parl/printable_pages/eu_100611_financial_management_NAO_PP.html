<p class="newsbody">COMMENTING ON the National Audit Office report on financial management 
  in the European Union, Richard Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, said: <br>
</p>
<P class="newsbold"> &#8220;The National Audit Office states that there has been a &#8216;detectable 
  improvement&#8217; in the EU&#8217;s financial management, which is not before time. 
  However, for the fifteenth year in a row, the EU has failed to provide 
  accounts for which the European Court of Auditors can provide a positive 
  Statement of Assurance on whether the underlying transactions conform to 
  applicable laws and regulations.<br>
      <br>
  &#8220;There continues to be an unacceptably high level of error. This is 
  because EU schemes are just too complicated. The government should press 
  at every opportunity for EU schemes to made simpler to operate, with 
  clear measurable objectives.<br>
      <br>
  &#8220;Poorly designed EU schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme 
  continue to hurt British taxpayers as well as being a nightmare for 
  farmers. The EU needs to work much harder to safeguard the money that 
  taxpayers across Europe entrust to it&#8221;.&nbsp; <br>
