<span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the National Audit Office report on the help given to carers by the Department for Work and Pensions, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said:

		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">
<b>
			&#8220;Some serious 
			concerns remain unaddressed in the delivery of benefits for carers.&#8221;</b>
			<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">
<b>
			</span></font>&#8220;Many carers are frustrated by delays and red tape.&nbsp; 
At least 20 per cent of carers are still finding it difficult to apply for the 
Carer&#8217;s Allowance, either because they struggle to understand application forms 
or they are uncertain of their eligibility.&nbsp; </span>Not all eligible carers know 
			that help exists and even where they are aware of this they might 
			not apply for fear that the person they care for would lose out. 
			What&#8217;s more, the Department does not even know the take-up rate for 
			Carer&#8217;s Allowance.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></font> </b>
			<p class="newsbody"><b>
			&#8220;</span>Given that 
			by 2015 there is likely to be a 25 per cent rise in the number of 
			carers supported by the Department, it is clear that there is still 
			much to do.&nbsp; The Department should address these outstanding areas 
			of concern without delay and ensure all carers get the support to 
			which they are entitled.&#8221; </font></b></p>
			<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons 
			public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office 
			published its report into the support given to carers by the 
			Department for Work and Pensions.&nbsp; 
			The report finds that the delivery of carer&#8217;s benefits is largely 
			successful and that a majority of those who receive support from the 
			Department are positive about their experiences.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
			<p class="newsbody">However, the number of carers is 
			growing and the Department estimates that the number of carers it 
			supports will grow by about a quarter by 2014-15.&nbsp; One fifth of 
			Carer&#8217;s Allowance applicants have difficulty in understanding 
			application forms, are unhappy about the length of time it takes to 
			process their claims for Carer&#8217;s Allowance claim and ten per cent of 
			those who reported a change of circumstances to the Department&#8217;s 
			Carer&#8217;s Allowance Unit experienced problems and were left uncertain 
			of their financial position.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
			<p class="newsbody">Additionally, the Department does not 
			know the take-up rate of Carer&#8217;s Allowance and not all eligible 
			carers apply for the support they are entitled to.&nbsp; This can be 
			because they are not aware of the Allowance, they do not think they 
			are eligible, they do not think of themselves as carers or they 
			choose not to apply because of the possible effect on the benefits 
			of the person that they care for.</span></font></div>
