<br>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has called on the Home Office to &#8216;get a grip&#8217;, as a new report finds that inadequate Home Office data on anti-social behaviour is yet another example of the Department&#8217;s failure to handle information properly. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;The Home Office&#8217;s 
  failure to provide adequate data on anti-social behaviour is just 
  the latest example of its inability to handle information properly.&nbsp; 
  Other cases have included foreign prisoners being released instead 
  of deported, and the failure to update criminal records with details of 
  serious crimes committed by Britons abroad&#8221;.<br>
      <br>
  &#8220;Without reliable management information the 
  Home Office can neither manage its business properly nor account for 
  its stewardship.&nbsp; They need to get a grip&#8221;.&nbsp; </b>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public 
    accounts committee published its report into tackling anti-social 
    behaviour.&nbsp; Despite recognising the 
    importance of accurate data, the Home Office provided data to the 
    National Audit Office on perceptions of anti-social behaviour which 
    the Home Office later admitted was incorrect.&nbsp; &nbsp;The report finds 
    that this is the latest of several recent examples of poor quality 
    information systems and data at the Home Office.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Inaccurate data was also provided to the Public 
    Accounts Committee in 2005 and 2006 on the release of foreign 
    national prisoners released from custody without consideration for 
    deportation.&nbsp; The Home Office had also not arranged for the Police 
    National Computer to be updated for notifications of convictions for 
    crimes committed abroad by UK citizens, allowing a backlog of some 
    27,500 cases to build up until updating commenced in 2006.</p>
