<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Barts cancer patients have urgent appointments delayed after problems with new NHS computer systems</p>
				<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">11 patients at 
				Barts and the London NHS 
				Trust have had urgent cancer appointments postponed for up to a 
				month because of problems with the new Care Records Service 
				installed under the £12.7 billion National Programme for IT 
				(NPfIT). The problems are disclosed in minutes of the Trust 
				Board reported in Computer Weekly. </p>
				<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">The delay is a 
				breach of the Government&#8217;s guarantee that every patient with 
				suspected cancer will get an appointment with a specialist 
				within two weeks. </p>
		<p class="newsbody">It is only one of a series of problems with 
		the Care Records Service at Barts. The Millennium software system was 
		provided by Cerner for British Telecom, the Local Service Provider for 
		Trusts in the London region. &nbsp;Barts went live in April with the biggest 
		new system so far installed under the NPfIT. </p>
		<p class="newsbody">The NPfIT &#8211; of which the Care Records Service is a 
		central part &#8211; was launched by the Labour government in 2002. It is the 
		world&#8217;s largest non-military IT programme, but has been hit by a series 
		of crises, including major delays in introducing the two key Care 
		Records software systems, iSOFT&#8217;s Lorenzo and Cerner&#8217;s Millennium.</p>
		<p class="newsbody">Commenting, Richard Bacon MP, a member of the 
		Public Accounts Committee which last week held hearings on the latest 
		National Audit Office report on the NPfIT commented:</p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This alarming news confirms a key truth about 
		the National Programme for IT. The Government&#8217;s original mistake in 
		over-centralising the Programme and trying to force Trusts to choose 
		from over-ambitious and untested systems offered by a small handful of 
		national suppliers has led to delays, failures and a deepening sense of 
		crisis. </b></p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The latest revelations from Barts show that 
		this is not just a story of about IT. These failures directly threaten 
		the standard of care offered to patients &#8211; in this case, patients with 
		suspected cancer. It is hard to imagine a more serious failure.&#8221;</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody">The Trust Board of Barts was told this week that 
		the implementation of the Care Records Service across the trust is the 
		most significant new risk since the start of the 2008/9 financial year. 
		They were also told that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li style="list-style-type: disc">
			<p class="newsbody">Breaches of the two-week urgent access guarantee to patients with 
		suspected cancer were &#8220;directly attributable to the erroneous migration 
		of outpatient clinics [data] at the change-over to [the] Care Records 
		Service.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="newsbody">The trust 
		is not receiving income for treating patients and does not have reliable 
		reports of patient activity &#8220;due to ongoing recording issues arising 
		from the implementation of the Care Records Service&#8221;.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="newsbody">The Trust 
		is &#8220;behind trajectory&#8221; on meeting the Government&#8217;s target for seeing 
		emergency patients within four hours. Reasons include &#8220;staff familiarity 
		with, and functionality of, the Care Records Service.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="newsbody">There was 
		a sharp increase in formal complaints from patients in the month the 
		Care Records Service went live. In April there were 95 formal 
		complaints, more than double the number in the same month in 2007. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="newsbody">Complaints included patients being booked into closed clinics and 
		appointments being cancelled repeatedly. &#8220;These issues and related Care 
		Records Service problems are being addressed and extra resources and 
		staff being deployed,&#8221; the Trust board was told.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="newsbody">Data 
		errors mean that some patient activity might have been overstated.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="newsbody">Reporting 
		errors are continuing &#8211; and there could be delays in reporting how the 
		trust is performing.</p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="newsbody">Problems 
		with the Care Records Service have led to duplicate outpatient 
		attendances and the creation of spurious events for some specialities, 
		which have &#8220;falsely inflated patient activity&#8221;</p></li>
			<li>
			<p class="newsbody">There are 
		&#8220;significant risks&#8221; to the trust being able to report its first-quarter 
		activity by the end of August.&nbsp; </p></li>
</ul>
		<p class="newsbody">Other NHS Trusts have also had problems with the 
		Cerner Millenium system, including Barnet and Chase Farm, Milton Keynes, 
		Nuffield Orthopaedic and Worthing. &nbsp;Weston Area Health NHS Trust have 
		spent more than 18 months trying to resolve problems with the Cerner 
		system, in part because the US software needs adapting to the UK market.<br>
