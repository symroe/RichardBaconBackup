<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">MP questions safety of UK cash in EU hands</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="MARGIN-LEFT:0pt"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has questioned whether UK taxpayers&#8217; money is safe in the European Union&#8217;s hands, after a new report finds the EU has failed to get a positive statement on its accounts for the twelfth year running.
<p class="newsbody" style="MARGIN-LEFT:0pt">Mr Bacon, a member of the 
  Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit 
  Office published its report into how the European Union (EU) handles its 
  finances.
  The report finds that the EU has failed to get a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors for the twelfth year in a row.
<p class="newsbody">In January 2005, President of the European 
  Commission Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, made it a strategic objective to get a 
  positive statement on the EU&#8217;s finances.&nbsp; However, in the same year, the 
  European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) was notified of 12,000 cases of 
  irregularity, including suspected fraud, with a value of some &euro;1 billion 
  (&pound;681.4 million).&nbsp; This represents an increase of 5.3 per cent on 2004.</p>
  <p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said today:&nbsp; &#8220;My constituents work 
    extremely hard to earn money to feed their families and pay their 
    bills.&nbsp; They will not be happy to see yet more of their cash slip 
    through the EU&#8217;s fingers, whether through fraud or incompetence.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbold">&#8220;A staggering 12,000 cases of irregularity in 
    2005 begs the question &#8216;is the UK&#8217;s money safe in the EU&#8217;s hands?&#8217;.&nbsp; 
    After 12 years of failure, the EU still does not have a convincing 
    answer.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbold">&#8220;If the EU cannot safeguard the moneys entrusted 
    to it by the taxpayers of this country, it is questionable whether it 
    should have them at all.&nbsp; It is time that member states put the EU on 
    notice that Europe&#8217;s taxpayers will only fund those parts of the 
    Commission that show a clean bill of financial health&#8221;.</p>
