<h3><span class="bwp4">MP calls for investigation into identity theft from government databases</span></h3>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has written to the head of the National Audit Office to ask for an investigation into the theft of personal identities from government databases.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> The recent report of the theft of personal identities from 13,000 civil servants working for the Department for Work and Pensions now appears to have been only one of a much larger number of significant frauds involving the use by organised criminal gangs of personal data which they had stolen from government databases. 
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"> Mr Bacon, a member of the influential Commons public accounts committee, has asked Sir John Bourn, Comptroller and Auditor General and head of the National Audit Office, to investigate the security of personal data held by government departments as a matter of urgency. 
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon's letter is as 
  follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"> <span class="bigword8"><strong>Sir John Bourn KCB <br>
  Comptroller and Auditor General <br>

<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><b> 12 May 2006 </b></p>
<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><b> Dear Sir John </b></p>
<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><u><b>THEFT OF PERSONAL IDENTITIES FROM DWP 
  AND HMRC</b></u> </p>
<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><b> I am writing to you about the theft of 
  personal identities from databases held by the Department for Work and Pensions 
  and from HM Revenue and Customs.</b></p>
<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><b> As you will know, there has been an 
  ongoing investigation into the theft of the details of some 13,000 civil 
  servants employed by the Department for Work and Pensions and the use of this 
  information by organised criminal gangs to commit fraud.</b></p>
<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><b> However, I understand that this incident 
  may only be one of a series of episodes of significant organised fraud 
  involving the theft of personal identities from government databases which are 
  now under investigation.</b></p>
<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><b> Given that you have placed a qualified 
  opinion on the accounts of the Department for Work and Pensions for many years 
  now, it is of great concern that the department remains open to organised fraud 
  on such a substantial scale and that its ability to account for how it spends 
  public money is getting worse rather than better.</b></p>
<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><b> Moreover, given that for the last 3 
  years you have placed a qualified opinion on the accounts of HM Revenue and 
  Customs precisely because of its difficulties in accounting for public money 
  spent on tax credits, it is very worrying that the scale of personal identity 
  theft involving the tax credits scheme is still not quantified.</b></p>
<p class="bigword8" style="margin-left:20pt; margin-right:10pt"><b>My concern is that the security of individuals&#8217; 
  personal details has been far more severely compromised than may have been 
  realised by the public.&nbsp; I would be most grateful if you would investigate 
  urgently the failure of these government departments to protect personal 
  identities from fraudsters.</b></p>
