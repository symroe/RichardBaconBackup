<p class="bwp4">Entice more scientists into teaching, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the Commons public  accounts committee&rsquo;s report on educating the next generation of scientists,  South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:</p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;It is good news that more  young people are choosing to study science and maths.&nbsp; However, if this  upward trend is to continue then it is vital that schools teach science and  maths in a way that is interesting, enjoyable and ultimately, successful.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Knowledgeable and enthusiastic  teachers are a key factor in boosting interest in science and maths, both in  lessons and as a career choice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, not enough science  graduates are currently training to be teachers, while schools in deprived  areas find it hard to attract teachers with a scientific  background.&nbsp;&nbsp; The quality of careers advice provided by some schools  for budding scientists and mathematicians is also poor.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;The Department for Education needs to look again at how  it persuades science and maths graduates to train as teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp; It  should also work alongside schools and local authorities to encourage  specialist teachers to take their skills into the most deprived areas&rdquo;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
