		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
		Bacon has said that aid should not go to countries who fail to honour 
		their promises to the UK, as a new report finds that the government has 
		not been checking regularly that the countries it helps are honouring 
		their commitments to human rights.
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
		<b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The Department for International Development wants the countries it helps to commit to reduce poverty, strengthen financial management and respect human rights. </b>  


			<p class="newsbody">
		<b>&#8220;While DFID is keeping a close eye on the first two commitments, 
		it is not giving the promise to respect human rights its full 
		attention.&nbsp; </b>
			
	
			<p class="newsbody">
		<b>&#8220;DFID must make sure that the countries it supports keep to their word. 
		Governments that violate human rights should not get a single penny from 
		the British taxpayer&#8221;.</b> <br>
		<br>
		Mr Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, was speaking as the National Audit 
		Office published its report on budget support for developing countries. Budget support is aid which the 
		Department for International Development (DFID) gives directly to the 
		government of a developing country, rather than to aid agencies working 
		on the ground. DFID provided £461 million in budget support to 13 
		countries in 2006-07, up from £268 million five years ago. This amounts 
		to nearly 20 per cent of its total bilateral expenditure.<br>
		<br>
		DFID requires a shared commitment to three objectives as a basis for 
		providing aid through budget support: reducing poverty and achieving the 
		Millennium Development Goals; strengthening financial management and 
		accountability; and respecting human rights and other international 
		obligations. The report finds that, while DFID&#8217;s monitoring of the first 
		two commitments is well established, monitoring of the commitment to 
		human rights has been less systematic.</p>
