<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard 
  Bacon has said that it is &#8216;shocking&#8217; that the NHS in the 
  East of England has a deficit of &pound;153 million, as a new report finds 
that the East is one of only two regions recording a deficit. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;It is shocking that the NHS in East Anglia has 
  recorded a deficit over three and a half times larger than the only 
  other area of the country in the red.&nbsp; This is a stark illustration 
  of the chronic under-funding of health services in the East compared 
  with what is needed&#8221;. </b>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;When doctors at the Norfolk and 
  Norwich Hospital are forced to treat patients in the car park 
  because there is not a single bed available in the whole hospital, 
  one cannot blame local NHS managers.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;It is quite obvious that local 
  resources are being pushed well beyond what is tolerable.&nbsp; The 
  responsibility for this rests squarely with central government&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit 
  Office published its report on the 2006-07 accounts of the NHS in 
  England.&nbsp; Strategic Health Authorities are responsible for 
  performance management of the NHS within their geographical area. 
  Only two of the ten Strategic Health Authority areas in England 
  reported a deficit in 2006-07 (East of England and South East 
  Coast), down from seven in 2005.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The report finds that the East of England 
  Strategic Health Authority area recorded a deficit of &pound;153 million, 
  over three and a half times larger than the South East Coast 
  Strategic Health Authority area&#8217;s deficit of &pound;42.7 million.&nbsp; </p>
