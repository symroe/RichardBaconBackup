<div class="bwp4">MP wants car criminals to have an unhappy Christmas

</div>

<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has warned shoppers to make sure it is not a happy Christmas for car thieves this year, as a new report by the Commons public accounts committee into vehicle crime is published. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The report reveals that 20 per cent of all car crime occurs in car parks, but less than 7 per cent of the 20,000 car parks in England and Wales belong to a safer car parks scheme started by the Association of Chief Police Officers. </p>
	<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the 
	  committee, has written to South Norfolk District Council regarding the 
	  security arrangements at the 17 car parks it runs.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">He has also written to Chief Constable Carole Howlett and asked&nbsp;how often&nbsp;police officers are patrolling car parks in order to deter thieves.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="newsbody">The report also finds that only a small number of 
	  parking sites at hospitals and railway stations can be classed as 
	  'secure', prompting Mr Bacon to contact 'One' Railways and the Norfolk 
	  and Norwich Hospital to enquire about security standards in their car 
	  parks.</p>
	<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;With preparations for Christmas in full swing, 
	  motorists need to feel confident that when they park their car in a town 
	  centre, it will be safe and secure.&nbsp; I have asked South Norfolk Council 
	  to let me know what steps they are taking to ensure that cars in the 
	  council's car parks are as secure as possible.</p>
	<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;The public also have a role 
	  to play in cutting car crime.&nbsp; I urge shoppers to be extra vigilant this 
	  Christmas, and keep valuables well out of sight, preferably locked in 
	  the boot of your car.&nbsp; That way, the only ones who won't have a happy 
	  Christmas are car thieves&ldquo;</p>
