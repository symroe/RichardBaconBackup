<h3><span class="bwp4">MP acts on headteacher shortage</span></h3>
  <p class="newsbody">SOUTH 
		    NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has written to county education bosses and 
		    asked them how they intend to attract headteachers, as a new report 
		    finds that there are a large number of vacancies for headships in 
		    England, and that the number of applications to fill these posts is 
  falling. </p>
  <p class="newsbody"> South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon,<font size="2"> </font>a<font size="2"> </font>member<font size="2"> </font>of<font size="2"> </font>the<font size="2"> </font>House
    of 
    Commons public accounts committee, took action as the National Audit 
    Office (NAO) published its report on Improving Poorly Performing Schools 
    in England this week. The report finds that over a quarter of primary 
    schools and a fifth of all secondary schools in England had headteacher 
    vacancies in 2004-05 and it also raises concerns that the large number 
    of headteachers set to retire in five to ten years&#8217; time will be very 
    difficult to replace. 
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b> Mr Bacon said today:  
  &#8220;At a time when 
    there is increasing recognition of the importance of the headteacher 
    within a successful school, fewer and fewer qualified candidates seem 
    willing to take the job on. Some education authorities are even offering 
    six-figure salaries to tempt the right candidate, but the issue is not 
    one of money. </b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;I believe the issue 
    is the flood of pointless initiatives, constant interference and 
    mindless bureaucracy that headteachers are faced with on a daily basis. 
    I am aware of two excellent headteachers in the Diss area who are 
    retiring early because of disillusionment with the level of bureaucracy 
    and it is little wonder that qualified candidates for headships are thin 
    on the ground. </b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;I have asked 
    officials at county hall how they intend to cut bureaucracy, address a 
    potential exodus of headteachers, and make a headship in one of 
    Norfolk&#8217;s schools a more attractive prospect&#8221;. </b></p>
