<p class="bigword4">MP calls for better advice on EU directives</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has called on ministers to work faster to explain the impact of EC law, after a new report finds that government departments have a poor record on providing timely guidance on EC directives. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report on the implementation of European laws.  
<p class="newsbody">The report states that the UK has a good record of turning EC directives into domestic law, but tends to adopt a &#8216;one size fits all&#8217; approach in guidance to those affected by new regulations, whether they are small family businesses or multi-million pound giants.
  
  
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon is a member of both the public accounts committee and the <a href="#esc" class="tsb">European scrutiny committee</a>, which looks at EC directives before they are allowed to become law.
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said:
  
  
  &#8220;It is the job of government departments to give advice to businesses and groups who will be affected by new EC directives, and they need to move faster on advising groups affected by new EC rules.
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;There are plenty of local examples of why guidance needs to be improved.  For example, Norfolk Gliding Club contacted me over proposed changes to EC regulations governing maintenance to their gliders.  Currently, gliders are serviced by owners and gliding clubs, but it was feared that the new directive would mean that gliders had to be serviced by certified aviation engineers, far too costly for the club to afford.
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;I raised this matter with the EC agency involved, who informed me that the proposed changes would actually allow owner pilots to undertake more service tasks, rather than less.  The explosion in online forums means that rumours and worries about particular EC directives can spread before the Government has had a chance to do anything about it.  Departments need to act much faster in future to inform and reassure those affected by changes in regulation.  Furthermore, in many cases we should be asking more questions about whether new EC laws are needed at all&#8221;.</p>
