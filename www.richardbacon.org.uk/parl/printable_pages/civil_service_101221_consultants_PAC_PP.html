<p class="newsbody">COMMENTING ON the Commons public  accounts committee&rsquo;s report on the Government&rsquo;s use of consultants and  interims, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;Departments spent over &pound;1 billion on consultants and  interims in 2009-10, but few departments know for certain whether they got  value for money from this spending and some departments appear to be hooked on  using consultants.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;For well over a decade, Whitehall has known that it is  weak in the areas of project management and computer skills, yet departments  are still relying too much on consultants for advice in these areas.&nbsp;  Whitehall needs to get in-house more of its own skilled people. </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;However, in  weaning themselves off quite so much consultancy advice, departments should  also beware a &lsquo;cold turkey&rsquo; approach, like the Department of Health&rsquo;s  determination to cut spending on consultants by 95 per cent by 2010-11.&nbsp;  Unless government departments are very careful, this may simply herald a  boom-time for consultants later if the skills required are not put in place  in-house.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;Consultants are an expensive resource so they must be  used with great care if the Government is to achieve value for money.&nbsp;  Departments need to work much harder to identify and fill key skills gaps in  their workforce before buying in consultancy advice&rdquo;</strong></p>
