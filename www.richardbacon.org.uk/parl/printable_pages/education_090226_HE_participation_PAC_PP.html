<h3>Government offers poor deal for poorest students, says MP</h3>
  <p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the publication of the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s 
    report into widening participation in Higher Education, South Norfolk MP 
    Richard Bacon, a 
    member of the committee, said:</p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;A university place should 
    be within the reach of anyone with the requisite grades.&nbsp; The Government 
    gave universities nearly &pound;400 million over five years to achieve this aim 
    and increase the number of people from poorer backgrounds in higher 
    education.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;However, this funding came 
    with very few strings attached, meaning that the government simply doesn&#8217;t 
    know enough about what universities actually did with the money.&nbsp; Whatever 
    action was taken, it has made almost no difference to the number of people 
    from poorer backgrounds enrolling on university courses and the government 
    has little to show for its investment.&nbsp; </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;Making sure talented 
    youngsters can get a university place, regardless of their background, is a 
    worthwhile goal but where public money is concerned, taxpayers have every 
    right to expect results.&nbsp; In future, the government must ensure that it is 
    crystal clear about how taxpayers&#8217; money is being used.&#8221;&nbsp; </b> </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr 
    Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its 
    report into widening participation in higher education.&nbsp; Between 2001&#8211;02 and 2007&#8211;08 the Department for Innovation, 
    Universities and Skills and the Higher Education Funding Council for England 
    allocated &pound;392 million of widening participation funding to higher education 
    institutions. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">The 
    report finds that the participation of young full-time students in higher 
    education has increased since 1999&#8211;2000, but only by two percentage points 
    over the last four years.&nbsp; Particular groups remain under-represented. Men 
    from lower socio-economic backgrounds are significantly under represented, 
    particularly those from white ethnic backgrounds, as are young people living 
    in deprived areas compared with the general population. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">The 
    report also finds that accountability for performance remains weak because 
    the Higher Education Funding Council does not require universities to 
    provide information on widening participation activities and expenditure.
