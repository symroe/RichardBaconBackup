<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has called on the government to learn the lessons of the failed Child Support Agency, as a new report finds that one in three non-resident parents do not pay the money they owe, leaving &pound;3.5 billion in uncollected maintenance.  
  
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report into the government&#8217;s attempts to reform the troubled Child Support Agency (CSA). 
  The report 
  finds that the reforms were a final but unsuccessful attempt to get the CSA back 
  on track.&nbsp; Currently, the CSA has failed to collect &pound;3.5 billion in 
  maintenance.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only 19,000 of the 247,000 cases of non-compliance were being 
  dealt with by the CSA&#8217;s enforcement directorate, leaving 92 per cent of 
  non-compliance cases where the absentee parent is not being chased.&nbsp; 
        <p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;I cannot recall a more badly run 
          programme in the public sector.&nbsp; It is now clear that the CSA bet all or nothing 
          on ambitious last-chance reforms and then lost, leaving the agency broken and 
          beyond repair&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Now, billions of pounds remain uncollected while absentee 
          parents know that avoiding their responsibilities is easy and that the chances 
          of the CSA taking effective action against them are low&#8221;.&nbsp;</b></p>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Unfortunately, the CSA&#8217;s problems look set to continue, 
          causing real hardship for families already in turmoil.&nbsp; The government must 
          learn from the CSA&#8217;s catastrophic mistakes and ensure the new Child Maintenance 
          and Enforcement Commission does not repeat them&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
        <p class="newsbody">The NAO report also finds that, under a new Chief 
          Executive, the CSA implemented a &pound;320 million operational improvement plan in 
          February 2006.&nbsp; The plan is aimed at tackling the backlog of cases and 
          stabilising the new IT system by fixing the 500 defects that were still present 
          three years after it was introduced. However, given the scale of the CSA&#8217;s 
          problems, many families could still face a long wait before they see any of the 
          money to which they are entitled from non-resident parents. </p>
        <p class="newsbody">In December 2006, the government announced that by 2008, 
          the CSA would be replaced with the Child Maintenance and Enforcement 
          Commission.&nbsp; The Commission&#8217;s aim is to deliver a simpler and more effective way 
          of assessing, collecting and enforcing child maintenance.</p>
