<p class="bwp4">Olympic Civil Servants should stay put</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"><b><i>Olympics is 
  too important to become a &#8216;merry-go-round&#8217; for civil servants&#8217; 
  careers, says MP</i></b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has called on the government to 
  ensure that top civil servants working on the Olympics stay in post 
  until the games are over, as a new report finds that continuity of 
  key people on major projects is vital to success.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"> <b>Mr Bacon said today:</b> <b>&#8220;Many government 
  projects have run into trouble because key people have moved on at the 
  wrong time and their skills have been lost.&nbsp; The Olympics is too 
  important to become a &#8216;merry-go-round&#8217; for civil servants&#8217; careers. 
  Those in key Olympic posts should now stay put until the 2012 Games are 
  over&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"><b>&#8220;It is worrying 
  that we still don&#8217;t have a clear idea who will own the Olympic venues 
  after the Games and what they will be used for. The government must 
  resolve its plans for these venues and above all avoid a repeat of the 
  Millennium Dome, which has only now found a use after years of sitting 
  idle&#8221;. </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"><b>&#8220;The government 
  cannot afford a weak approach to managing risk.&nbsp; The Department for 
  Culture, Media and Sport must keep its 17 lead bodies on a tight leash, 
  ensuring they work to time and that risks to delivery are reported 
  diligently&#8221;.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">Mr Bacon was speaking 
  as the Commons public accounts committee published its report on 
  preparations for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&nbsp; According 
  to the report, strong progress monitoring and risk management 
  arrangements are essential for the Games&#8217; success, but are not yet in 
  place.&nbsp; The large number of bodies involved is also found to present 
  significant risks to timely decision-taking.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">The report also finds 
  there is a lack of clarity about how venues will be used after the 
  Games, with concerns that the design of Olympic venues will fail to 
  reconcile the needs of the Games with those of subsequent users. &nbsp;</p>
