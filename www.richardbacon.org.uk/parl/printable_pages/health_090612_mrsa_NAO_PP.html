<p class="bwp4">Too many hospitals 'losing the superbug battle', says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the publication of the National Audit Office report on reducing hospital-acquired infections in England, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said: </p>
<p class="newsbody"> <b> &#8220;The Department of Health has spent &pound;120 million on tackling hospital-acquired infections and met its target to cut MRSA 
  bloodstream infection rates in half by 2008.&#8221;</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;However, the picture across England is patchy and the 
  report makes it clear that some hospitals are losing the 
  battle against MRSA and <i>C. difficile</i>.  Whilst a quarter of hospital Trusts have cut their MRSA infection rates, a further 12 per cent of Trusts saw their MRSA infection rates increase and, for <i>C. difficile</i>, infection rates rose at one in five Trusts.&#8221;</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;What&#8217;s more, whilst the Department of Health has focused on fighting MRSA and <i>C. difficile</i>, 
  other hospital-acquired infections may be on the rise.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>&#8220;Any 
  progress in making hospitals cleaner and safer is 
  welcome, but the government must work harder to help 
  those hospitals still struggling to beat MRSA and <i> <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">C. difficile</span></i>.&nbsp; 
  The Department of Health also needs to boost 
  infection prevention and control measures in order 
  to stop less well known hospital-acquired infections 
  from taking hold.&#8221;</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office published its report on hospital-acquired infections in England.  The Department of Health has spent some &pound;120 million on tackling hospital-acquired infections, and introduced a target to reduce MRSA across all NHS trusts by 50 per cent by 2008 and <i>C. difficile </i>by 30 per cent by 2010-11.  MRSA had been reduced by 57 per cent by the end of March 2008 and <i>C. difficile</i> by 41 per cent. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">While a quarter of trusts have reduced MRSA by more than 80 per cent, in 12 per cent of trusts there has been an increase in MRSA infections.  Twenty-nine per cent of trusts have reduced <i>C. difficile </i>by more than 50 per cent, but in 19 per cent of hospital trusts the numbers of <i>C. difficile </i>infections have increased. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">The report also finds that the information that is available suggests that other healthcare associated bloodstream infections, including ones due to other antibiotic resistant organisms, may have increased. Most staff and patients are less aware of the risks of acquiring these other infections and there is scope therefore for hospitals to improve infection prevention and control further.</p>
