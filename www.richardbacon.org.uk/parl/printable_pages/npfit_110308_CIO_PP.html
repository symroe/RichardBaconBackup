		    <p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, has responded to answers  to his detailed questions on the future of the controversial National Programme for IT in the NHS from Ms Christine Connelly, Chief Information Officer at the Department of Health.</p>
		    <p class="newsbody">In his response, Mr Bacon <a href="#fund" class="tsb">presses for an answer</a> to his specific question over whether the contract renegotiations with BT and Cerner represented  best value for taxpayers&rsquo; money, stating:
            <blockquote class="newsbold">&ldquo;Although I am  grateful for your detailed reply, I do not see any direct answer to that  question, which seems to me absolutely fundamental.&rdquo;</blockquote>
            <p class="newsbody">In his <a class="tsb" href="/parl/npfit_110117_CIO.html#dearmsc">letter</a> of 13 January to Ms  Connelly, Mr Bacon expressed concern over the value for money provided by BT's &pound;546 million contract for the South of England and  called into question whether, given the proposed reductions in the functionality and  the number of software packages being deployed under the  contract,  Ms Connelly could still be confident that value for money was being provided. </p>
            <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon's  letter of 2 March is <a href="#connelly" class="tsb">below</a>. You can read Ms Connelly's letter, in response to Mr Bacon's original letter of 13 January 2011, <a href="/parl/npfit/110124_Christine_Connelly_to_Richard_Bacon_MP.pdf" class="tsb">here</a>. </p>

              <p class="edirots"><strong>CONTRACT NEGOTIATION IN THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR IT IN  THE NHS</strong></p>
              <p class="edirots">Thank you very much for your letter of 24th  January 2011. </p>
              <p class="edirots">In my original letter to you of 13th January  2011, I asked you specifically whether the contract renegotiations with BT and  Cerner represented best value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.&nbsp; <a name="fund"></a>Although I am  grateful for your detailed reply, I do not see any direct answer to that  question, which seems to me absolutely fundamental.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="edirots">Unless the question can be answered clearly in the  affirmative, I can see no justification for concluding further agreements with  these companies, at least until after the NAO has reported and the Public  Accounts Committee has had time to consider its findings. I am disappointed  that you have not given such a commitment and I would ask you again to consider  doing so.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="edirots">I would also like to address some of the specific points in  your letter. </p>
              <p class="edirots">My  point about the Cerner product in London was that originally planned  deployments of GP systems, a London Ambulance solution and a number of systems  in acute trusts were included in the original contract price of &pound;1.2 billion <strong><em>and  are not now being delivered</em></strong>.&nbsp; I note that you do not comment on my  observation that only about half the original contract will be delivered, but  that payments have been reduced by only &pound;112 million.&nbsp; I cannot see how  this can be value for money to taxpayers and I note that you do not claim that  it is.</p>
              <p class="edirots">You say that I am &ldquo;misinformed&rdquo; about the level of Cerner  functionality, which you say &ldquo;has not been reduced&rdquo;.&nbsp; I must refer you to  page 23 of the June 2006 NAO report in which it is stated that Cerner  Millennium was being supplied in four releases, covering the same functionality  as the original five IDX releases. This included a Patient Administration  System, a GP system, a web based referrer, a pharmacy system, and systems for  acute departments, emergency care and mental health, all to be delivered as an  integrated Cerner solution. Much of this has now been dropped, or replaced with  cheaper departmental systems such as RiO, but I cannot see that taxpayers have  seen an appropriate consequent saving.</p>
              <p class="edirots">You acknowledge that the history of delivery of Lorenzo is  &ldquo;very unsatisfactory&rdquo;, a point on which we can certainly agree. My additional  point is that there is no good reason to think that the long record of unmet  promises, missed deadlines and in some cases outright misrepresentation is  about to change. Therefore, I can see no good reason for the Department to  persist with supporting the deployment of the Lorenzo system through the  contract with CSC. I note that the Chief Executive of the NHS and the President  of CSC were scheduled to meet to discuss this matter and I sincerely hope that  this does not simply result in further unreliable promises and consequent  failures. </p>
              <p class="edirots">In relation to the price of the RiO product, I would observe  that the systems supplied directly by CSE Servelec seem to be functioning in  practice as well as the LSP version, so I cannot see how there is a good reason  for the price of the LSP versions to be around ten times as high. As you say,  this is likely to be considered by the NAO. In the interim, I should be happy  to supply a list of non-NPfIT RiO users if that would assist you in making the  comparison. My concern about value for money to taxpayers is of course not  related to whether the decision was made entirely by your Department or with  some involvement by the Treasury. </p>
              <p class="edirots">Since my letter to you there have been further reports that  raise doubts over the effectiveness of LSP systems, including:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li class="edirots">serious under-use of Lorenzo at NHS Bury; </li>
                <li class="edirots">a failure to go live with Lorenzo at Pennine Care NHS       Trust; and </li>
                <li class="edirots">a call for compensation by North Bristol NHS Trust for       late delivery of a PAS system. </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="edirots">These reports simply add to my concern that you seem to  remain committed to the delivery of systems through LSPs that have been shown  to be unreliable, subject to serious delays and, even after contract  renegotiations, unreasonably expensive. Quite apart from the burden this places  on taxpayers at a time of exception stringency in public spending, it is also  surely not in the interests of the NHS and its patients. </p>
              <p class="edirots">I do sincerely hope that you will now feel able to give a  commitment not to enter into revised contracts until the NAO has reported and  the PAC has considered the matter. </p>
              <p class="edirots">Yours sincerely<br>
                  <br>
