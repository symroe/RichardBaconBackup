    <br>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
      Bacon has said that the government's scheme to compensate coal workers 
      was badly botched, as a new report finds that more was&nbsp; spent on 
      red tape than it has helping miners suffering with lung disease.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The planning of the Coal Health Compensation Schemes was badly botched.&nbsp; As a result, two-thirds of miners suffering with lung disease got less in compensation than the government spent on processing their claims&#8221;.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The planning of the Coal Health 
      Compensation Schemes was badly botched.&nbsp; As a result, two-thirds of 
      miners suffering with lung disease got less in compensation than the 
      government spent on processing their claims.&nbsp; The government also 
      underestimated the number of claims it would get by more than 300 
      per cent.&nbsp; What&#8217;s more, some sick and elderly miners have been kept 
      waiting more than a decade for compensation&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
    <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This scheme is costing far too much to run 
      and has kept miners waiting too long for compensation.&nbsp; The 
      remaining claims should be settled as quickly and cost-effectively 
      as possible&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>
    <p class="newsbody" 
   style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none">Mr. Bacon, MP for South 
      Norfolk, was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee 
      published its report on the Coal Health Compensation Schemes.&nbsp; In 1998, the courts found the British Coal 
      Corporation negligent in respect to lung disease caused by coal dust 
      (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD) and hand injuries 
      caused by using vibrating equipment (Vibration White Finger or VWF).&nbsp; 
      The former Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) had already taken 
      responsibility for the Corporation&#8217;s accumulated personal injury 
      liabilities and, under the courts and in negotiation with claimant&#8217;s 
      solicitors, established two schemes to pay compensation.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody" 
   style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none">The report finds that, for 
      the COPD scheme, around 69 per cent of claimants receiving 
      compensation got less than the average cost of administering a 
      claim.&nbsp; The DTI also failed to seek actuarial advice during the 
      planning phase. As a result, it underestimated the likely volume of 
      claims by over 300 per cent and allocated an insufficient number of 
      staff to manage the liability.&nbsp; Consequently some claimants have had 
      to wait as long as ten years or more. </p>
    <p class="newsbody" 
   style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none">The successor to the DTI, 
      the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBERR) 
      estimates that it will have paid some &pound;4.1 billion in compensation, 
      plus &pound;2.3 billion in administration costs, by the time the schemes 
      are completed.&nbsp; This means that for every &pound;2 paid out to miners, 
      over &pound;1 will have been spent on administration.</p>
