		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has called on the government to help its flagship academies sort out a tax mess, as a new report finds that academies are being forced to restrict community groups from using their facilities in order to avoid VAT liability, despite the fact that academy buildings were always intended for community use.  

		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
		Local groups using more than 10 per cent of an academy&#8217;s area, time or 
		capacity would make the academy liable for full-rate VAT on its entire 
		construction cost, far exceeding any rental income generated.  

			<p class="newsbody">VAT rules are also impacting on the design of 
			academies, with one academy opting to demolish and rebuild a sports 
			hall at a cost of £1 million, rather than face a VAT bill of £4.25 
			million.  </p>
			<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;VAT is stopping academies 
			from playing a full role in their local communities. Academies 
			should not have to shut out community groups in fear of the taxman, 
			nor put their own budgets at risk just to open their facilities to 
			local people&#8221;. </b>  </p>
			<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This lunacy has already forced one academy 
			to tear down facilities and rebuild them, simply because doing so 
			cost less than a quarter of the VAT demand. This is a total waste of 
			time and money and the government should resolve this issue 
			quickly&#8221;. </b>  </p>
				<p class="bwp6"><b>Academies 
				project management 'weak' says MP</b><br>
				<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon also has called for 
				better project management for the academies programme, as the 
				national audit office report finds that building costs overran 
				on two thirds of new academies, with some project managers 
				showing poor control of costs and a lack of knowledge of either 
				construction or education issues. </p
				><p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said 
				today: &#8220;The government has only managed to build around one 
				third of academies on budget, clearly indicating that project 
				management is weak.&nbsp; It is common sense that an academy&#8217;s 
				project manager needs to understand both education and 
				construction issues, yet some managers do not have the required 
				knowledge with sadly predictable results.&nbsp; This must be 
				addressed now or the building costs of academies will continue 
				to overrun&#8221;.</b><p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
				National Audit Office published its report into the academies 
				programme today (Friday 23 February 2007).&nbsp; The report finds 
				that the building costs of 17 out of 26 academies overran by an 
				average of £3.2 million.&nbsp; 
					<p class="newsbody">There has also been criticism of some 
				project managers for poor control of costs and their failure to 
				notify officials of cost overruns.&nbsp; Project managers need to 
				understand both educational and construction issues, but some 
				project managers only had relevant knowledge and experience in 
				one area. </p>
