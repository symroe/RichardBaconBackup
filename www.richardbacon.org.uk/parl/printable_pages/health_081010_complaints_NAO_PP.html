<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons 
  public accounts committee, has urged the NHS and local social care services to 
  learn from the complaints they receive.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;One in seven people using the NHS and social care 
  services were unhappy with their experience.&nbsp; However, the vast majority of 
  those who were dissatisfied did not make a formal complaint, largely because 
  they felt it would come to nothing.&nbsp; This report shows that they were right&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The current complaints system is confusing and little 
  help is available for would-be complainants to navigate the system. What&#8217;s more, 
  an excellent opportunity to improve health and social care services is being 
  lost because the NHS and social services do not systematically learn from 
  complaints&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Criticism is not necessarily destructive and the NHS and 
  social services need to find ways to channel what they learn into service 
  improvements.&nbsp; Until they do, public pessimism over making a complaint will 
  remain well-founded&#8221;. </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) 
  published its report into how complaints about health and social care services 
  are handled.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">According to an NAO survey, around one in seven people using 
  NHS and social care services in the past three years have been dissatisfied with 
  their experience.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">However, only five per cent of those who were dissatisfied 
  with the NHS and 32 per cent who were dissatisfied with social care went on to 
  make a formal complaint. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The main reason people did not complain formally was that 
  they did not feel anything would be done as a result.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The report finds that navigating the complaints systems is 
  not straightforward, particularly for health service users. Over two thirds of 
  those making a complaint were not offered any help in navigating the complaints 
  process and a fifth said their experience was difficult.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Additionally, neither the NHS nor social care has any formal 
  means of capturing cross-organisational learning.</p>
