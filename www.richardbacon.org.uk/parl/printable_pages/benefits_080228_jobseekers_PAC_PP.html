<div class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Training can break the benefits cycle, says MP</div>
				<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has said that training can break the cycle of jobseekers moving from benefits to employment and back again, as a new report finds that boosting the skills of disadvantaged workers could save over half a billion pounds. 
</p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Many hard-to-employ people need to 
				improve their basic literacy and numeracy if they are to find 
				and keep a job.&nbsp; This would break the cycle of jobseekers moving 
				on and off benefits and could save taxpayers half a billion 
				pounds.&nbsp; However, those needing to boost their skills can find 
				it hard to access help or to get training from their employers.&nbsp; 
				If the government is to realise these savings, disadvantaged 
				workers must get the advice and support they need, and convince 
				employers of the value of training their staff&#8221;.</b></p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The new Skills Accounts sound like a 
				good idea, but then so did the Individual Learning Accounts and 
				just look at what happened there.&nbsp; ILAs were an open goal for 
				fraudsters, who conned taxpayers out of millions of pounds and 
				left would-be-learners without the training they needed&#8221;.&nbsp; </b>
				</p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The government says it has now learned 
				the lessons of the ILA fiasco.&nbsp; I certainly hope so, but as the 
				new Skills Accounts scheme has not yet been risk-tested against 
				fraud, the early signs are not encouraging&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
				<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, was 
				speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its 
				report on sustainable employment.&nbsp; Over a fifth of people who leave benefits and enter work 
				return to Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance within 13 weeks, and 40 per cent 
				are back on benefits within six months.&nbsp; People increasingly 
				need better skills and qualifications to compete in today&#8217;s 
				labour market, but the report finds that disadvantaged workers, 
				such as those with poor numeracy or literacy, can encounter 
				difficulties in accessing sound advice on local learning 
				opportunities and how these will increase their employability.				</p>
				<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">The report 
				also that finds people with the lowest skills are the least 
				likely to be trained by their employers.&nbsp; Gaining vocational 
				qualifications in the work place can improve the earnings and 
				productivity of low skilled adults but depends on the 
				willingness of employers to support such training. &nbsp;;</p>
				<p class="newsbody">The new Skills Accounts programme will 
				allow adult learners to use public money to purchase relevant 
				learning at an accredited provider of their choice.&nbsp; The scheme 
				aims to build on the lessons of the Individual Learning Accounts 
				(ILA) programme, which closed in 2001 following evidence of 
				abuse. However, the report finds that the new scheme has not yet 
				been risk-tested against malpractice.&nbsp; </p>
