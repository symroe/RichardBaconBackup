<p class="bigword4">MP calls for action on illegal pork</p>
<br>
<p class="newsbody">South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon has led a debate in the House of  Commons calling on Ministers to do more to support the UK&rsquo;s hard-pressed pig  farmers, following the introduction on 1st January 2013 of strict  new EU rules aimed at protecting pig welfare.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Most EU countries have not  adapted their farming systems to comply with the new rules, despite having had  a decade to get ready, so that there is now a serious risk of increased imports  of illegally produced meat.&nbsp; In 1999 the UK voluntarily introduced the new  higher welfare standards which have recently become compulsory throughout the  EU.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon called for government help in making the supply chain for  pork and pork products fully traceable and transparent, so that retailers,  processors and the government itself as a buyer do not import illegally  produced pork into Britain from European farms that fail to meet the new legal  standards.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: </span><strong>&ldquo;Poor harvests last year  have resulted in high feed costs, meaning that many of the UK&rsquo;s pig farmers are  already under heavy financial pressure.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;If the EU&rsquo;s illegal farms either  complied as they should do, or got out of the pig industry, this would create a  brighter future for those who have invested and worked hard to make sure the  pork they produce is legal.&nbsp; There are three steps the Government can take  to improve matters.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;First, the Government  must ensure that there is absolute clarity in its Buying Standards for pork and  other pig meat products, ensuring traceability from farm to fork.&nbsp; The  public sector is a big buyer of food - for the armed forces, schools, the NHS  and other public sector bodies - and taxpayers have every right to expect that  their money will never be used for the purchasing of illegally produced meat.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Second, retailers and  food service companies must also be encouraged to operate a fully traceable  supply chain so that they can guarantee that the pork they are selling is  legal.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Finally, the Government  must press the European Commission for effective enforcement action.&nbsp; The  UK is one of just ten EU Member States which are fully compliant with the pig  welfare Directive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other 17 Member States have had over a  decade to prepare for this moment and any further delay is completely  unacceptable&rdquo;. </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">On 1 January 2013, European  Council Directive 2008/120/EC came into force across the EU.&nbsp; The  Directive lays down minimum standards for the protection of pigs and sets out a  range of requirements for their welfare, most notably, a partial ban of the use  of sow stalls during pregnancy. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The UK has been fully  compliant with these standards since 1999 and 1 January 2013 was the final  deadline for pig farmers across Europe to comply with these regulations.&nbsp;  However, many farms in the EU&rsquo;s biggest pork producing countries, such as  Germany, France and Denmark, remain non-compliant with the Directive.&nbsp;  Illegally produced pork is finding its way into the UK supply chain, forcing  down prices and, along with the poor harvest and high feed cost, increasing the  pressure on the UK&rsquo;s pig farmers yet further.</p>
