<p class="bwp4">Job scheme 'like Mary Celeste', says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody">South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon has likened Northern 
  Ireland's largest training programme to the Mary Celeste, the infamous abandoned 
ship, with nobody seemingly in charge of the &pound;0.5 billion scheme.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the 
  Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the committee's report on the 
  Jobskills scheme was published.&nbsp; The programme 
  was launched in 1995 and was intended to raise the skills level of those for 
whom academic education is inappropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon said: &quot;This scheme was 
  like the Mary Celeste. No-one appeared to be in charge.&nbsp; There were plenty of 
  signs that Jobskills was drifting out of control, such as high levels of early 
  leaving from the scheme and training providers whose contracts were renewed 
  despite offering poor quality service.&nbsp; However, even with these spiralling 
problems, no action was taken&quot;.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The Committee describes the scheme as one of the worst-run 
  programmes it has seen, with a quite astonishing catalogue of failures and 
  control weaknesses.&nbsp; The Report finds disturbing levels of complacency within 
  the Department of Employment and Learning and makes it clear that Jobskills has 
  not received the senior management attention it deserves.&nbsp; Jobskills was also 
  not compared with similar schemes elsewhere in the UK, a common problem for 
Departments in Northern Ireland.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon added: "It is very hard to point to evidence that 
  anyone at the Department had a sufficient grip of the problems with Jobskills.&nbsp; 
  People in Northern Ireland deserve better.&nbsp; It is time that public services in 
the Province are at least on a par with the rest of the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
