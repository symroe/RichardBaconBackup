<h3><span class="bwp4">MP tells taxman to &#8216;get real&#8217; over 
savings</span></h3>
  <br>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has 
    said that HM Revenue and Customs needed to &#8216;get real&#8217; over an &pound;11.5 
    billion business transformation scheme that a new report has called 
    &#8216;highly ambitious&#8217;. 
    
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b> Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;HM Revenue and Customs has begun a &pound;2.7 
    billion transformation programme which aims to realise an estimated 
    &pound;11.5 billion of savings&#8221;.&nbsp; </b>
  <p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;This estimate includes an increase of &pound;6.3 billion 
    in the tax yield and some &pound;4 billion of transaction savings&#8221;.&nbsp; </b>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;However, the estimates are based on the 
    increased tax yield being collected in full and transaction savings 
    which have not been validated yet.&nbsp; This is hardly solid ground for a 
    multi-billion pound savings drive&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The report could not be clearer: a programme of 
    this size and complexity needs realistic planning.&nbsp; If the mandarins at 
    HMRC think using sketchy and volatile estimates is the way to drum up 
    serious savings, they need to get real&#8221;.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office 
    published its report into HM Revenue and Customs&#8217; transformation 
    programme.&nbsp; HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) 
    plans to spend &pound;2.7 billion from 2006-07 to 2010-11 on a transformation 
    programme to improve its services and detection of non-compliance 
    easier.&nbsp; As a result of this programme, HMRC expects to achieve benefits 
    valued at &pound;11.5 billion by 2011.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="newsbody">Most of the &pound;11.5 billion benefits are expected to 
    come from an increased tax yield of &pound;6.3 billion and transaction savings 
    to business and government of &pound;4.1 billion. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">However, the report 
    finds that the estimate of additional tax yield is volatile and assumes 
    collection in full. HMRC also has yet to assess customer benefits for 
    some programmes and fully validate the &pound;4 billion transaction savings.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">The report identifies 
    realistic planning as an issue and recommends that HMRC sets out more 
    clearly what change programmes can realistically achieve, and establish 
    a clearer list of priorities.</p>
