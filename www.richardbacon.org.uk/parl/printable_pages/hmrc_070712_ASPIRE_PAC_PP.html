<br>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has expressed concern that HM Revenue and Customs negotiated a key part of a &pound;3 billion computer deal with IT supplier Capgemini after the firm had already won the contract, on which costs have now exploded to &pound;8.5 billion. 
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"> <b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;When they signed this deal, Capgemini probably could not believe their luck.  HMRC contributed to the cost of their bid and agreed to pay transition costs, which were not negotiated until after the firm had won the contract&#8221;.</b>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;By waiting until the competition was over, HMRC 
    effectively shot itself in the foot.&nbsp; It ended up haggling with 
    Capgemini over which costs were &#8216;unique&#8217; and even agreed a 15 per cent 
    profit margin.&nbsp; Given that the contract is now costing three times the 
    original &pound;3 billion deal, this agreement is proving to be very 
    profitable for Capgemini but very expensive for taxpayers&#8221;.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report into ASPIRE, a &pound;3 billion contract to 
    provide IT services for HM Revenue and Customs. Because of an increase in demand for IT services, the cost has 
    now risen to &pound;8.5 billion over the 10-year life of the contract.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">To encourage competition against incumbent suppliers 
    EDS and Accenture, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) agreed to pay 
    transition costs to any new supplier.&nbsp; HMRC did not, however, agree the 
    value of these costs until after the contract was signed with Capgemini.&nbsp; 
    As part of these negotiations, HMRC agreed a 15 per cent profit margin 
    and spent considerable time negotiating whether a particular cost was 
    unique or not.</p>
  <p class="bwp6"><b>TAX CREDITS</b><BR>
      <span class="newsbody">The report also finds that, in settling its claim 
        against computer firm EDS for problems with the tax credits system, HMRC 
        agreed that &pound;26.5 million of the settlement could be paid in 
        instalments.&nbsp; These payments are dependent upon EDS winning new business 
        from the government, despite their track record on tax credits. </span> </p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon added: &#8220;It is not obvious why the 
    government should give further work to EDS just to get compensation for 
    the firm&#8217;s poor performance.&nbsp; Many of my constituents are facing real 
    hardship as a result of computer failures in the tax credits system, and 
    they do not expect the company at the centre of the fiasco to get 
    further work from the government&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
