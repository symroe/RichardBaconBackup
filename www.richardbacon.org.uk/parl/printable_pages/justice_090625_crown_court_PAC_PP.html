<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">MP urges Crown Courts to learn from Norfolk</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on </span>the publication of the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report into the administration of the Crown Court, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:
<p class="newsbody"> <b> &#8220;HM Courts Service will miss its target for commencing cases 
    committed for trial in the Crown Court and there are wide variations 
    across England and Wales in the time taken to commence Crown Court trial 
    cases&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;In 
    particular, the performance of Crown Courts on the South East 
    Circuit, which includes the East of England, is mixed.&nbsp; Crown Courts 
    in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk are performing better than 
    other courts on the Circuit&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;In fact, Norwich is the best 
    performing Crown Court on the South East Circuit, and commenced 94 
    per cent of its cases within the government&#8217;s time targets in 
    2007-08.&nbsp; Not bad when you consider that last year, the Ministry of 
    Justice spent less in the East of England per head of population 
    than anywhere else in England.&nbsp; Other courts in the South East, 
    particularly those in the Thames Valley, are not doing so well&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;The South East 
    Circuit is now being given additional resources by HM Courts 
    Service.&nbsp; However, courts that are struggling to commence cases in a 
    timely manner could do worse than learn from the success of Norwich 
    and of high-performing courts on other circuits&#8221;.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons 
    public accounts committee published its report into the 
    administration of the Crown Court.&nbsp; The 
    report finds that HM Courts Service will not meet its target for 
    commencing cases committed for trial which arise when a defendant 
    opts to have a case heard in the Crown Court, or magistrates decide 
    that this should happen. Performance varies widely across the 
    Service&#8217;s 24 areas and for 2009&#8211;10, the Courts Service has targeted 
    additional resources to those regions which manage the areas 
    expected to face greatest demands. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">In particular, it has given 
    London region and South East region sufficient resources to operate 
    their Crown Court rooms for an additional 1,285 days and 821 days 
    respectively in 2009&#8211;10.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"> According to its 2007-08 Annual Report, Norwich Crown Court remains at the 
    forefront of courts across the whole country in terms of timeliness, 
    with over 94 per cent of cases commenced within the time targets 
    set.&nbsp; Norwich is the best performing Crown Court on the South East 
    Circuit. </p>
<p class="newsbody"> The Ministry of Justice, which has responsibility for HM 
    Courts Service, spent &pound;114 per head of population in the Eastern 
    region last year, the lowest spending in England.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry 
    expects its spending in the East to peak at &pound;117 per head before 
    falling to &pound;111 per head by 2010-11.&nbsp; However, spending in the East 
will remain the lowest in England. </p>
