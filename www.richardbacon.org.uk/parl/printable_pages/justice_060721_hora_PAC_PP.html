<p class="bwp4">Home Office accounts 'are a national disgrace' says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has described the Home Office accounts as a &#8216;national disgrace&#8217; as a new report says the department's top civil servant failed in his duty to Parliament to present a set of audited accounts.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report on major flaws in the troubled department's finances. 
  
  
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">When Parliament's financial watchdog, the National Audit Office, looked at data produced by the Home Office's new finance system, Adelphi, it found the gross value of debits and credits amounted to some &pound;26,527,108,436,994 (i.e. &pound;26.5 trillion), almost 2,000 times higher than the Home Office's spending for 2004-05 and approximately one and a half times higher than the estimated GDP of the entire planet. 
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"> Mr Bacon, a member of the committee, said:</p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b> &#8220;The Home 
		  Office could not even reconcile its cash records with its bank 
		  statements, nor provide a set of audited accounts for Parliament. Even 
		  worse, the Home Office seemed not to understand the vital importance of 
		  doing this. As a result, the Home Office cannot say with any certainty how much it spent during 
		  the year, what debts it was owed and what it owed to others, or what 
assets it owns&#8221;.</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b> &#8220;There is no assurance that all expenditure incurred during the year was 
		  in line with what Parliament authorised and financial information 
		  provided by the Home Office is unreliable. These are the most basic 
		  failures of financial stewardship and control.&nbsp; It is a national 
disgrace&#8221;.</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"> The report states that the Home Office&#8217;s Accounting Officer&nbsp; - i.e. the 
		  Department&#8217;s senior civil servant, then permanent secretary Sir John 
		  Gieve &#8211; failed in his duty to Parliament to account for how taxpayers&#8217; 
		  money is spent, leaving his successor (Sir David Normington) in the 
		  unenviable position of having to sign unauditable accounts so that they 
could be presented to Parliament.</p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b> Mr Bacon said: &#8220;In any parish council or cricket club the person 
		  responsible would have been out on his ear.&nbsp; What actually happened was 
		  that he was promoted to become Deputy Governor of the Bank of England in 
		  charge of financial stability in the banking system. You might 
		  reasonably expect to see this in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, but not 
in real life&#8221;.</b></p>
