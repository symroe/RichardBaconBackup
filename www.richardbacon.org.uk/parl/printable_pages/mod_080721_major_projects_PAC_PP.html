<p class="bwp4">MoD budget 'camouflage' won't keep costs down, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP 
  Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee 
  has said that the MoD is 'camouflaging' its budgets to give the 
impression it has procurement costs under control. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt"><b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The MoD might 
  claim to have reduced its procurement costs, but in truth it has simply moved 
  money around to give the impression that procurement costs are under control&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;&pound;1 billion has been transferred between projects and 
  budget lines since 2005&#8221;.&nbsp;</b> </p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;These transfers are acting as a smokescreen, hiding 
  costs such as logistics and training, and masking the fact that costs are not 
  really falling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the same people continue to be responsible for the 
  transferred budgets, which often get moved to smaller projects attracting less 
  attention from Parliament or the press&#8221;.</b> </p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This creative accounting might produce better-looking 
  balance sheets, but it does nothing to improve the MoD&#8217;s management of 
  procurement costs.&nbsp; Rather than camouflage its balance sheets, the MoD needs to 
  take a long, hard look at why it still cannot keep procurement costs under 
  control&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts 
  committee published its report on the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s major procurement 
  projects.&nbsp; Since April 2005, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has reduced the 
  forecast costs for its top 20 projects by reallocating expenditure to other 
  projects or budget lines. In 2007, it has reallocated &pound;609 million, making a 
  total of over &pound;1 billion reallocated over the last two years. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The report finds that, by transferring costs outside the 
  boundaries of the Major Projects Report, the MoD is not providing Parliament 
  with the full picture on the cost of individual military equipment projects. &nbsp;In 
  addition, these transfers may not represent a cost reduction for defence 
  spending as a whole and the transferred budgets also fail to include training 
  and logistics support costs. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt">The report also finds 
  that, although allocating costs to those best placed to manage them is sensible 
  for accountancy purposes, many of the same project teams continue to be 
  responsible for the transferred budgets.</span></p>
