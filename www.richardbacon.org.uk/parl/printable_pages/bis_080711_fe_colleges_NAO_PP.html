<p class="bigword4">Renovation scheme pushed colleges &pound;700 million into the red, 
says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon 
  has said that a scheme to renovate England&#8217;s further education colleges has also 
  pushed them into debts of &pound;700 million.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The Further Education Capital Programme has pushed colleges deeper into the red.&nbsp; &nbsp;The sector was already &pound;200 million in debt and this scheme has forced colleges to add over half a billion pounds to that debt.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;As colleges&#8217; debts rose, their financial 
  competence appears to have fallen.&nbsp; Almost a quarter of colleges are 
  now classed as &#8216;financially weak&#8217; and five per cent have long-term 
loans of more than 40 per cent of their income.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Many colleges are now dependent on demand 
  for their courses just as the economy takes a turn for the worse.&nbsp; 
  Colleges must strengthen their financial management and ensure they 
can service their debts&#8221;.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit 
  Office published its report into the project to renovate further 
  education colleges in England.&nbsp; The 
  Further Education Capital Programme is intended to enable England&#8217;s 
  376 colleges to replace poor quality buildings with high quality 
  facilities.&nbsp; However, the report finds that the funding arrangements 
  for the programme caused college debts to increase from around &pound;200 
  million in 2001-02 to &pound;731 million in 2006-07, and that these debts 
will continue to rise rapidly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">The report also finds that, between 2005-06 and 
  2006-07, the number of colleges assessed as being &#8216;financially weak&#8217; 
  increased from 68 to 89, meaning that 24 per cent of colleges are 
  now classed as &#8216;financially weak&#8217;.&nbsp; Additionally, 19 colleges (five 
  per cent) had long term borrowings of more than 40 per cent of their 
  income in 2006-07.&nbsp;  Colleges with large 
    debts could be more vulnerable to loss of income if they fail to 
    generate the projected demand for courses from employers and 
learners.</p>
