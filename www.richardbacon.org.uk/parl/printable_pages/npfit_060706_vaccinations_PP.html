<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">MP asks Hewitt to explain child vaccination chaos</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk MP</span> Richard Bacon has demanded an explanation from health 
  secretary Patricia Hewitt after an official report disclosed that problems 
  with new computer systems are reducing immunisation levels for children in 
  London.</span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">Mr 
  Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, wrote to the health 
  secretary today (Thursday 6 July 2006) after the Health Protection Agency 
  disclosed worrying trends in child immunisation levels in the capital, with a 
  consistent fall in coverage of between 7% and 10% for measles, mumps and rubella 
  and up to 19% for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough during the past year in 
  which new child health systems have been non-functional.</span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">The 
  report states: &#8220;Falls in coverage of this magnitude not only indicate that 
  individual children may be at risk, but also represent a potential major public 
  health threat to the control of the diseases in the community&#8221;.</span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">Mr 
  Bacon said: &#8220;The national vaccination programme has been one of the NHS&#8217;s 
  greatest successes. It relies on straightforward systems which have been 
  developed over the years for sending invitations for vaccination, identifying 
  unvaccinated children, sending reminders and tracking their status for catch-up 
  campaigns. Connecting for Health appears to be destroying this at the touch of a 
  button&#8221;.</span></b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">The 
  reports are contained in <i>CDR Weekly</i>, an official journal of the Health 
  Protection Agency which tracks communicable diseases (CDR Weekly Volume 16, 
  Number 25, published 22 June 2006). The journal states: </span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">&#8220;This 
  is the third quarterly report in which national trends could not be reported due 
  to problems with new child health systems being implemented in London. Comparing 
  the year 2005/6 to 2004/5, the number of children in London who are missing from 
  the COVER programme is nearly 18,000 for children turning 12 months, over 14,500 
  for children turning 24 months and nearly 19,000 for children turning 5 years of 
  age&#8221;. </span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="color:black">Mr 
  Bacon said there have been contradictory statements by NHS Connecting for 
  Health, the agency running the new NHS IT programme, and the Health Protection 
  Agency.&nbsp; In March 2006 </span><span lang="EN" style="color: black">Dr Martin 
    Baggaley, clinical director for NHS Connecting for Health in London, issued a 
    press statement: &#8220;I would like to offer reassurance that the new computer system 
    will not have put individual children at any increased risk of missing their 
    vaccinations&#8221;.&nbsp; However, the </span><span style="color:black">Health Protection 
      Agency&#8217;s Communicable Disease Report Weekly for 22 June 2006 states: &#8220;the fact 
      that no information has been collected on their vaccination status means that 
      those who have missed out vaccines for whatever reason are unlikely to have been 
      identified and followed-up&#8230;&#8230;.. If new child systems fail to deliver these 
      functionalities then children risk missing out on vaccination. Thus, they remain 
      unprotected and eventually will catch measles, mumps, and rubella infections.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b><span style="color:black">Mr 
  Bacon said: &#8220;These wildly contradictory statements will cause great confusion 
  and concern for many parents of young children in the London area.&nbsp; I have asked 
  the health secretary for an urgent explanation of how she plans to solve these 
  problems, which have been created as a direct result of the new NHS IT 
  programme&#8221;.</span></b></p>
