    mentality led directly to Chinook fiasco, says MP</div>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none; text-align:justify"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the publication of the Commons public accounts committee report on the procurement of eight Chinook Mk3 helicopters by the Ministry of Defence, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said: </p>
<b>&#8220;The MoD baulked at the cost of putting digital cockpits into eight Chinook helicopters which it had ordered for the SAS.&nbsp; Instead, the MoD picked a bizarre bargain bin specification 
					that nobody else used.&nbsp; As a result, the MoD now has eight 
					helicopters that still cannot fly on a cloudy day and have 
					still not entered service.&#8221;&nbsp;
                    <p class="newsbold">&#8220;Then, 
                      having spent more than five years mulling over its &#8216;Fix to 
                      Field&#8217; project to make the Chinooks operational, the MoD 
                      suddenly axed the scheme in favour of another project called 
                      &#8216;Reversion&#8217;.&nbsp; However, the MoD did not talk to Boeing, the 
                      Chinook&#8217;s manufacturer about the cost and timescale of 
                      Reversion before axing Fix to Field.&nbsp; This has led to a 70 
                      per cent increase in estimated costs and none of the eight 
                      Chinooks has yet entered operational service.&#8221; </p>
                    <p class="newsbold">&#8220;You really 
                      couldn&#8217;t make this up.&nbsp; Over &pound;400 million of taxpayers&#8217; 
                      money has so far been wasted because the MoD was penny wise, 
                      pound foolish.&nbsp; The irony is that for vastly less money than 
                      this, the MoD could have bought more Chinook helicopters 
                      that worked properly.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
    Commons public accounts committee published its report on 
    the procurement of eight Chinook Mk3 helicopters by the 
    Ministry of Defence.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody"> In 1995, 
    the Ministry of Defence (MoD) ordered 14 Chinook Mk2a 
    helicopters, eight of which were modified to Mk3 standard in 
    order to meet a requirement for Special Forces. The Mk3 
    Chinooks feature unique cockpit avionics which, because of 
    the Department&#8217;s budgetary priorities elsewhere, ended up 
    being a hybrid of analogue and digital systems, rather than 
    purely digital systems as used by US Special Forces&#8217; 
    Chinooks and by the Royal Netherlands Air Force.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="newsbody"> Further operational 
    requirements and difficult commercial negotiations led to a 
    five year period of protracted negotiation and slow decision 
    making under a project known as &#8216;Fix to Field&#8217;.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody"> In 2007, 
    the MoD scrapped the Fix to Field project in favour of a new 
    project called Reversion, designed to accelerate the 
    helicopters&#8217; entry into operational service. In assessing 
    the Reversion project, however, the MoD failed to consult 
    with Boeing, the manufacturer of the Chinook, with regard to 
    the potential costs or timeframes and the estimated cost of 
    the project subsequently grew by 70 per cent.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"> The cost of the 
    eight Chinook Mk3 helicopters once they enter service will 
    be in excess of &pound;422 million, or &pound;52.5 million each. &nbsp;
