<h3>Government websites 'spinning out of control', says MP</h3>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP 
  Richard Bacon has said that the government's websites are &#8220;spinning 
  out of control&#8221;, as a new report finds that the government 
  does not know how many websites it actually has.</span>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s websites are spinning out of control. The government does not know how many websites it runs and over a quarter of government bodies cannot say how much their websites have cost the taxpayer&rdquo;. 
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt"><b>&#8220;Just having a website appears to be an end in itself for many 
  departments and agencies. The government needs to sort out its online 
  services and collect the data it needs to run responsive, cost-effective 
  websites&#8221;. </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published 
    its report on government on the internet. 
    The government spends an estimated &pound;208 million a year on delivering 
    services online. However, the report finds that a quarter of government 
    organisations cannot provide data on the cost of their websites and 16 
    per cent of government organisations do not have a good knowledge about 
    the users of their websites. </p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt">The government is to move most of its services and related information 
    to two websites, direct.gov.uk and businesslink.gov.uk, by 2011. The 
    government also aims to streamline its web presence by closing almost 
    1,000 unnecessary sites. </p>
