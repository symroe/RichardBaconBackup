<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Norfolk and Norwich Hospital 'paying a premium for PFI', says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody">Following the publication of a 
  National Audit Office Report on the refinancing of Norfolk and Norwich 
  Hospital, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public 
  accounts committee, said: 
<p class="newsbold" >&quot;The report confirms that the hospital continues to pay a premium 
  for its financing compared to deals now available in the market, 
  even after receiving a share of the refinancing gains&quot;. 
<p class="newsbold" >&quot;It is true that the PFI 
  market has matured in recent years and better priced deals are now more 
  common. 
<p class="newsbold">However, as the report points out, a funding 
  competition for the original deal would have put greater pressure on 
  the cost of finance provided by the banks&quot;. </p>
				<p class="newsbold">&quot;I believe it was a mistake not to hold such a funding competition. 
				  It is precisely when there is a significant delay in closing a deal 
				  that a funding competition will be most useful in ensuring that the 
				  best possible financing terms are obtained. For example, the funding 
				  competition held by the Treasury for the redevelopment of its own 
				  building produced a &pound;13 million saving for taxpayers&quot;.<br>
              <br>
  &quot;The Department of Health also acknowledges in the report that there 
				  are a range of other factors which affect PFI pricing which it has 
				  not yet fully analysed&quot;. <br>
              <br>
  &quot;It seems clear that Norfolk and Norwich Hospital is paying a 
				  premium for being an early PFI hospital. Given the continued 
				  financial difficulties faced by the Norfolk health economy, there is 
				  a case for a one-off payment by the Department to compensate for 
				  higher on-going costs which will be faced by the hospital for many 
				  years&quot;.				</p>
