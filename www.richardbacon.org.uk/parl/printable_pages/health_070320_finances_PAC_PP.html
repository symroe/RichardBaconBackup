<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">MP says NHS deficit is causing local damage</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has called on top health officials to find out more about what is actually happening in NHS, as a new report says the Department of Health does not have a firm grasp of the impact of deficits on the NHS&#8217;s capacity to deliver local services.
<p class="newsbody style1" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"> Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The real impact of these deficits is being felt locally, 
  where services are being cut and investment in much-needed facilities 
  such as Diss Medical Centre is being put on hold&#8221;. </p>
		<p class="newsbody"><strong>&#8220;Unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t registering in Whitehall, 
		  where there is limited information about redundancies, closures and 
		  abandoned capital programmes.&#8221;</strong></p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;It is hard to reconcile the huge sums of money that 
		  have been thrown at the NHS with the fact that many Trusts are in the 
		  red. There is not one single cause for these deficits, but clearly the 
		  NHS does not possess the financial expertise it needs&#8221;. </b>
        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;It has not 
          exactly helped that Department of Health officials got their sums wrong 
          when negotiating the national pay deals for doctors, consultants and 
          other NHS staff, leaving the NHS to fund much of the resulting &pound;560 
          million shortfall. Whitehall makes the errors but it is local health 
          services that feel the pain&#8221;. </b>
        <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public 
          accounts committee published its report into financial management in the 
          NHS.&nbsp; The report finds that the Department of Health does not have an 
          overall picture of the impact of deficits on the NHS&#8217;s ability to 
          deliver services, and that there is a lack of financial management 
          expertise in the NHS. 
        <p class="newsbody">Errors in the costing of the Agenda for Change pay 
          initiative, General Practitioner and consultants contracts meant that in 
          2005&#8211;06, individual NHS Trusts had to help fund the resulting &pound;560 
          million shortfall.&nbsp; The report also finds that decisions by strategic 
          health authorities on the amount of financial support for NHS bodies in 
          deficit and whether deficits incurred by NHS bodies should be repaid in 
          the next financial year are not being applied consistently across the 
          NHS, and that there is a need to improve communication between Trust 
          managers and clinicians.
