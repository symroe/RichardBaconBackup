			<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt">SOUTH NORFOLK MP 
			Richard Bacon has said that the £30 million the government spent on 
			an asylum centre than never opened could have been used to end the 
			police pay dispute. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">
			<b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The Home Office says it can&#8217;t afford £30 
			million to settle the police pay dispute, but it was quite prepared 
			to blow this amount on a half-baked asylum project that never got 
off the ground&#8221;.</b></p>
            <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The proposed 
			Bicester asylum centre was part of a £34 million project to house 
			asylum seekers which collapsed before building work began, leaving a 
			semi-derelict site&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
			<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Police officers 
			have every right to be angry that money that could have funded their 
			pay rise was frittered away on this dead-end plan&#8221;.</p>
			<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons 
			public accounts committee published its report on the cancellation 
			of the Bicester asylum centre.&nbsp; 
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="newsbody">Between 2001&#8211;02 and 2005&#8211;06, the Home Office planned a 
			purpose-built accommodation centre for asylum seekers at Bicester in 
			Oxfordshire as part of a wider Home Office accommodation project for 
			asylum seekers.&nbsp; However, falling numbers of asylum applicants, 
			rising costs and an improvement in the processing of asylum 
			applications led to the cancellation of the Bicester centre in June 
			2005.&nbsp; The Home Office spent £33.7 million on the accommodation 
			project, including £29 million on the Bicester centre.&nbsp; The report 
			finds that the Bicester scheme did not deliver any benefit to 
			taxpayers, and that the expected costs of the centre had outweighed 
			its intended benefits from the start. </p>
			<p class="newsbody">Earlier this year, the Home Office 
			decided against backdating an agreed 2.5 per cent pay rise for 
			police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to September, meaning 
			the rise only amounts to 1.9 per cent.&nbsp; Funding the 2.5 per cent 
			rise would cost £30 million.&nbsp; </p>
