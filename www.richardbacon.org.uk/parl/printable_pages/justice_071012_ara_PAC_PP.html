<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has said that the Agency set up to recover the proceeds of crime might as well have been run by Inspector Clouseau, as a new report finds that the Agency has failed on almost every front.
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
		Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report into the Assets Recovery Agency.&nbsp; 
		Set up without a business case in 2003, the Assets Recovery Agency was 
		meant to be self-financing by 2005&#8211;06.&nbsp;  
			However, by December 2006 the Agency had only recovered £23 million, 
			despite costing £65 million to run.&nbsp; The Agency has no powers to 
			launch investigations itself and is reliant on cases being referred 
			to it.&nbsp; However, only 129 out of 696 possible referral partners sent 
			cases to the Agency.&nbsp; The Agency has also suffered from high staff 
			turnover and lost half of its legal team within one year.<p class="newsbody">A comprehensive database of the Agency&#8217;s cases was not kept, and the 
			Agency did not keep track of the accreditation of its trained 
			Financial Investigators.&nbsp; As a result, only 1,400 of the 4,500 
			investigators trained by the Agency were still active by summer 
			2006.&nbsp; The Agency is due to be axed in 2008 and its powers shared 
			between the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the National 
			Policing Improvement Agency.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The Assets Recovery Agency is little short of a 
			laughing stock.&nbsp; It has made so many basic errors it might as well 
			have been run by Inspector Clouseau.&nbsp; It is amazing that any assets 
			were recovered at all&#8221;. &nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			&#8220;We simply cannot afford the Agency&#8217;s feeble approach to dealing 
			with hardened criminals.&nbsp; I hope that the Serious and Organised 
			Crime Agency and the National Policing Improvement Agency make 
			better use of these powers and ensure that crime does not pay&#8221;.</b></p>
