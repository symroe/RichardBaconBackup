<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">NHS 'fined' millions by computer companies</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">SOUTH NORFOLK MP 
  Richard Bacon has established through answers to parliamentary questions 
  that NHS Trusts are being fined millions of pounds because of their 
  inability to lend enough NHS staff to computer contractors running the 
  NHS&#8217;s &#8216;Connecting for Health&#8217; I.T. programme.&nbsp; In the South of England, 
  the NHS has been forced to buy itself out of a commitment to provide NHS 
  staff to the computer company Fujitsu, at a cost of &pound;19 million.&nbsp; In the 
  North West and West Midlands region, the NHS faces paying penalties of 
  &pound;6.9 million per year to the computer company CSC, potentially each year 
  over the 10-year life of the contract.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the 
  Commons public accounts committee, said&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;At a time when hard-pressed 
  NHS Trusts are having to make painful choices in order to reduce deficits, they 
  are being forced to pay money they don&#8217;t have and release staff they can&#8217;t 
  spare, for something they don&#8217;t want and which doesn&#8217;t work&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;It is surprising that 
  negotiators believed NHS Trusts would be able to spare large numbers of staff 
  for this scheme.&nbsp; It is even more surprising that the NHS must pay financial 
  penalties if it can&#8217;t find all the expected staff to lend to computer 
  suppliers.&nbsp; The NHS is being hit with fines running into tens of millions of 
  pounds, which it simply cannot afford&#8221;.<br>

<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: left"><em>Parliamentary Question and answer follows:<b></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="newsbody"><strong>Health Suppliers</strong></p>

<blockquote class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none; text-align:left">Mr. Bacon: To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what the 
  contracted obligations of the public sector are under the Connecting 
  for Health Supplier Attachment Scheme; what the maximum cost to 
  public funds is of not meeting these obligations; and if she will 
  make a statement; [51694] <br>
              <br>
  (2) what representations (a) her Department and (b) Connecting for 
  Health have received from (i) local service providers and (ii) NHS 
  bodies about the Supplier Attachment Scheme. [51698] <br>
              <br>
  Mr. Byrne: The supplier attachment scheme is an arrangement by which 
  national health service personnel are seconded on a temporary basis 
  to work with local service providers to the national programme for 
  information technology (LSPs) to ensure that the systems and 
  services being developed and deployed meet the needs of the NHS. 
  Fulfilment of the arrangement has advantages for the NHS in 
  compensating price reductions and ensuring that NHS expertise is 
  readily available to LSPs. <br>
              <br>
  The current contractual liability to LSPs in each cluster area in 
  respect of the Supplier Attachment Scheme is as follows: <br>
              <br>
  London Cluster&#8212;none<br>
  <br>
  North West/West Midlands Cluster&#8212;50 whole-time equivalent staff 
  (&pound;6.9 million) per year<br>
              <br>
  North East and Eastern Clusters (jointly)&#8212;242,000 man days over the 
  term of the contract (no contracted financial obligation).<br>
              <br>
  Southern Cluster&#8212;an agreement has been reached to buy out the 
  liability at a cost of &pound;19 million in 2006&#8211;07 as NHS trusts have 
  decided not to supply the staff resources. The LSPs have said that they greatly value the arrangement and the 
  benefits they derive from it. </blockquote>
