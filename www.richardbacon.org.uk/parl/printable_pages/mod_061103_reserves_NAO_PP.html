		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
		Bacon has expressed concern over the inability of the Armed Forces to 
		keep skilled personnel, as a new report finds that it costs £189 million 
		for the Ministry of Defence to recruit 2,500 people and train them to a 
		basic level, but only £74 million to retain the same number of 
		fully-trained service personnel. <br>
		<br>
		Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee who served in the Territorial Army, was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into Reserve Armed Forces.  
		<br>
		<br>
			Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces today (Friday 3 November 2006).  The number of troops leaving the forces early has continued to increase, with 9,200 personnel leaving prematurely last year.  An NAO survey found that 49 per cent of those who recently left the Armed Forces did so because of the impact of service life on their families.  A further 28 per cent left because of too many deployments.  
			<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;This proves that 
			treating our troops properly is not only the right thing to do, it 
			is also the most cost-effective thing to do. Our troops do a heroic 
			job and I am very concerned that the MoD appears increasingly unable 
			to hang on to them&#8221;. <br>
			<br>
			&#8220;The MoD must provide as much stability and certainty as possible 
			for service personnel and their families, otherwise an increasing 
			amount of experience, manpower and money will be lost&#8221;.</b><br>
			<br>
			The report also finds there are &#8216;pinch points&#8217; in certain specialist 
			trades. The Armed Forces have only 67 Accident and Emergency nurses 
			against a requirement for 210. There has been a 25 per cent 
			shortfall in Army Ammunition Technicians, who are specially trained 
			to defuse terrorist devices. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Mr Bacon added: &#8220;Given that in Iraq alone, 902 UK troops were 
			admitted to field hospitals and 332 coalition soldiers were killed 
			by explosive devices so far this year, this situation is completely 
			unacceptable. These are vital roles that need to be filled and 
			ministers must address these shortfalls at once&#8221;. </b></p>
