	<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the Commons public  accounts committee&rsquo;s report on the 2009-10 accounts of HM Revenue &amp; Customs  (HMRC), South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:</p>
	<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;The failed  implementation of HMRC&rsquo;s new National Insurance and PAYE Service (NPS) in 2009  has caused ripples of chaos to spread throughout the income tax system.&nbsp; </strong></p>
	<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Software problems  delayed the processing of the 2008-09 PAYE returns for a year and disrupted the  issue of tax codes for 2010-11.&nbsp; HMRC  tried to keep the volume of PAYE processing manageable by raising the recovery threshold  from &pound;50 to &pound;300, throwing away &pound;160 million of revenue in the process.&nbsp; HMRC also knew seven million taxpayers had  either overpaid or underpaid tax in December 2009, but kept these taxpayers in  the dark until September 2010, causing them worry and uncertainty.&nbsp; </strong></p>
	<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;It is also extraordinary that the UK&rsquo;s  premier taxation authority failed to understand the Finance Act&rsquo;s deadlines on  collecting tax and so lost an estimated &pound;650 million in underpaid tax.&nbsp; </strong></p>
	<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;HM Revenue &amp;  Customs has failed in its duty to taxpayers to process PAYE accurately and on  time.&nbsp; HMRC must get its act together and  stabilise the PAYE system as soon as possible&rdquo;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<span class="bwp6" style="text-decoration:underline">HMRC&rsquo;S Acting Chief Information Officer</span><br>
    <span class="newsbold">&ldquo;HMRC re-hired its acting Chief Information  Officer (CIO) on a three month contract for a whopping annual equivalent of  &pound;600,000, even though he had failed to get the job on a full-time basis.&nbsp; As if paying the acting CIO four times his  previous salary was not generous enough, HMRC then spent a further &pound;20,000  helping him to find another job afterwards.</span>
    <p class="newsbold">&ldquo;People worried about  their jobs will have every right to be angry over HMRC&rsquo;s extraordinary  largesse.&nbsp; HMRC could easily have planned  for an orderly transition to its new CIO and it speaks volumes about the  approach of HM Revenue and Customs that it did not&rdquo;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
