<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Government &lsquo;sloppy&rsquo; on efficiency gains, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has described the government&#8217;s attitude to making efficiency gains as &#8216;sloppy&#8217; after a new report finds that there is doubt over whether nearly three-quarters of the government&#8217;s reported &pound;13.3 billion in efficiency gains are genuine or accurate.
<p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published 
  its report on the government&#8217;s efficiency programme.&nbsp;                  
  The government&#8217;s efficiency programme aims to make efficiency 
  gains of &pound;21.5 billion a year by 2007-08. However, although 
  government departments had reported &pound;13.3 billion of annual 
  efficiency gains up to 30 September 2006, the report finds that 
  departments cannot show whether almost &pound;10 billion of these gains 
  are genuine. There is also uncertainty around whether gains have 
  been measured without taking account of additional costs.
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;This approach to reporting efficiency gains is just plain sloppy.  If the government was serious about hitting its &pound;21.5 billion target, it would not present a figure that does not bear close inspection.  The government needs to look at this again and come up with more credible figures&#8221;. </p>
