<p class="bwp4">Government 'dragging its feet' in superbug fight, says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none; text-align:justify"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report on the reducing healthcare associated infection in England&#8217;s hospitals, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said: 

<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none; text-align:justify"><b> &#8220;The Department of Health has taken one step forward, two steps back in the fight against hospital-acquired infections. </b>
<p class="newsbold"><b>&#8220;Although there has been some progress in the fight 
  against Meticillin resistant <i> <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Staphylococcus 
    aureus</span></i> (MRSA) and <i> <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">C.</span></i> <i> <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">difficile</span></i> infections in England&#8217;s hospitals, the Department of 
  Health is still in the dark over 80 per cent of 
  healthcare-associated bloodstream infections.</b></p>
<p class="newsbold"> <b>&#8220;This means the NHS is effectively fighting hospital 
  superbugs with one hand tied behind its back.&nbsp; The 
  Department also &#8216;cannot say&#8217; why two out of five 
  hospital trusts are only monitoring MRSA and <i> <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">C. difficile</span></i>, 
  which risks letting other superbugs run rampant.</span></font></b></p>
<p class="newsbold"> <b>&#8220;The Department of Health has been previously warned 
  not to focus only on MRSA and <i> <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">C. difficile </span> </i>to the exclusion of other superbugs, but little 
  appears to be changing.&nbsp; The Department must stop 
  dragging its feet and boost infection monitoring and 
  control measures in order to keep less well-known 
  but equally dangerous infections out of our 
  hospitals.&#8221;</span></font></b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr Bacon was speaking 
  as the Commons public accounts committee published 
  its report on the reducing healthcare associated 
  infection in England&#8217;s hospitals today.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt">Every 
    year over 300,000 patients in England acquire a 
    healthcare associated infection whilst in hospital 
    costing the NHS more than &pound;1 billion a year. These 
    infections are caused by a variety of organisms and 
    lead to a range of symptoms from minor discomfort to 
    serious disability and even death.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">In 2007, there 
  were 9,000 deaths recorded with Meticillin resistant <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Staphylococcus 
    aureus</span></i> (MRSA) or <i> <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Clostridium 
      difficile (C. difficile)</span></i> infections as 
  the underlying cause or a contributory factor.&nbsp; The 
  report finds that the Department&#8217;s approach to in 
  reducing MRSA and <i> <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">C. difficile</span></i> infections has been successful. </p>
<p class="newsbody">However, the 
  Department has not achieved measurable reductions in other, 
  avoidable, healthcare associated bloodstream infections.&nbsp; The public 
  accounts committee recommended in 2005 that the Department expand 
  mandatory surveillance to other healthcare associated infections, 
  but this latest report finds that this recommendation has not been 
  implemented and <span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt">there is still 
    no robust comparable data on the extent and risks of at least 80 per 
  cent of healthcare associated infections.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.15pt">The report adds that, w</span>ithout 
  surveillance information, the Department has no idea of the true 
  scale of all healthcare associated infections and the risk they pose 
  to patients.&nbsp; The Department also could not explain why 20 per cent 
  of trusts had carried out no additional surveillance on infections 
  other than MRSA and <em>C. difficile.</em></p>
