<blockquote><span class="newsbold">&quot;The  abuses at Winterbourne View residential hospital underline the need to take  more care in handling information from whistleblowers and also raise serious  questions about the leadership of the Care Quality Commission&quot;.&nbsp;</span><span class="newsbold_red"><br>
    <em class="newsbody_red">Richard  Bacon MP </em></span></blockquote>
<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the publication of the National Audit  Office report into the Care Quality Commission, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon,  a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said: </span><span class="newsbold"><br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  <strong>&ldquo;The Care Quality  Commission was created by merging three health and social care regulators and  has a remit to register health and adult social care providers, to check their  compliance with essential standards and to take enforcement action where  necessary.&nbsp; However, after the Commission opened in April 2009 it  experienced difficulties from the start.&nbsp; </strong><br>
  <strong>&nbsp; </strong><br>
  <strong>&ldquo;Just 53 per cent  of provider registrations were completed on time and the Commission missed two  out of three registration deadlines.&nbsp; Under pressure, the Commission opted  to prioritise registration over compliance checks, resulting in only 47 per  cent of its planned reviews being completed between October 2010 and March  2011.</strong><br>
  <strong>&nbsp; </strong><br>
  <strong>&ldquo;It was during  this period that the Commission received information from a whistleblower  regarding serious abuse taking place at the Winterbourne View residential  hospital.&nbsp; However, instead of contacting the whistleblower immediately,  the Commission passed the information to South Gloucestershire County Council  and then failed to check what action, if any, the Council had  taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br>
  <strong>&nbsp; </strong><br>
  <strong>&ldquo;The abuses at  Winterbourne View residential hospital underline the need to take more care in  handling information from whistleblowers and also raise serious questions about  the leadership of the Care Quality Commission.&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;It is welcome  that health and social care providers will be inspected at least once a year  from April 2012 but it is not clear that the Commission is ready to expand its  remit to oversee fertility clinics and HealthWatch England. There is a risk  that this may distract the Commission from its core work&rdquo;.&nbsp;</strong></p>
