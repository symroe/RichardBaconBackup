<p class="bwp4">Olympics budget worthy of 'Del Boy' says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">A member</span> of the public accounts committee has described the Olympic budget process as worthy of TV&#8217;s famed dodgy-dealer Del Boy, as a new report finds that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport failed to allow for VAT, corporation tax or programme management costs in its original budget.&nbsp; 
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said today: &#8220;The government 
  &#8216;forgot&#8217; it had to pay over &pound;800 million in VAT and other taxes.&nbsp; 
  Then it &#8216;forgot&#8217; it needed &pound;570 million for effective programme 
  management. &nbsp;What else has it forgotten?&nbsp; Taxpayers cannot 
  afford any more expensive memory lapses&#8221;.</b>
            <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none; margin-right:0pt"><b>&#8220;The way DCMS has 
              handled the Olympic budget is like an episode of <i>Only Fools and 
                Horses</i> &#8211; no corporation tax, no VAT, no money back, no guarantee.&nbsp; 
              Del Boy couldn&#8217;t have done it better&#8221;. <sup>*</sup></b></p>
            <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>&nbsp;&#8220;Officials at DCMS are unlikely to see a penny over the &pound;9.3 
              billion already allocated, while the report is clear that the budget 
              will only be enough if DCMS officials have got their sums right.&nbsp; 
              Worryingly, there has been little sign of that so far&#8221;.&nbsp; </b>
            <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was 
              speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report 
              into the budget for the 2012 Olympic Games today (Friday 20 July 
              2007).&nbsp; The report finds that, at the time of the bid, the estimated 
              cost of the Olympics was just over &pound;4 billion, to be met by &pound;3.4 
              billion in public funding and an anticipated &pound;700 million from the 
              private sector.&nbsp; The budget announced in March 2007 is now over &pound;9.3 
              billion, with a much reduced private sector contribution. 
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> The new budget includes a new provision of &pound;836 million for VAT and 
              corporation tax, following the Treasury&#8217;s confirmation in March 2007 
              that the Olympic Delivery Authority would be liable to VAT in the 
              normal manner and unable to reclaim it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The report also states 
              that the revised &pound;9 billion budget should be sufficient to cover the 
              estimated cost of the Games, with the important proviso that the 
assumptions on which the budget is based hold good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>            <p class="asublist" style="margin-left:0pt"> <i>* The new provision of &pound;836 million for tax comprises &pound;736 
              million in VAT and &pound;100 million for corporation tax and stamp duty.&nbsp; 
              This provision was not made until the revised budget announced in 
              March 2007.&nbsp; For further details, see the NAO Report page 16, Figure 
              6, Note 5.<br>
