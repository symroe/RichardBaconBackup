	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has written to Southern Norfolk Primary Care Trust to ask them to make sure that terminally ill cancer patients do not miss out on the non-means tested benefits that are currently going unclaimed.

	</b>

	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon acted as the Commons public accounts committee, of which Mr Bacon is a member,

	published their report on the patient's experience 
		of cancer treatment.&nbsp;

		<p class="newsbody">The report finds that three-quarters of cancer 
		patients are not told that the terminally ill are eligible for financial 
		help that is not means tested.&nbsp; This means terminally ill sufferers with 
		six months or less to live are currently missing out on an estimated 
		£200 million in benefits per year.</p>
		<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon said today:</p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&quot;Whilst I know that not everyone will want to 
		claim this money, it is important that cancer patients know that it is 
		available.&nbsp; It could potentially make a very real difference to 
		sufferers and help make their last days more comfortable&quot;.</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&quot;Cancer does not respect age, fitness or wealth.&nbsp; 
		Those who are terminally ill must not miss out on this chance to 
		alleviate financial hardship because they don't know it exists.&nbsp; I have 
		urged the PCT to make sure that all cancer patients in their area know 
		about these benefits and how they can claim them should they wish to&quot;.
