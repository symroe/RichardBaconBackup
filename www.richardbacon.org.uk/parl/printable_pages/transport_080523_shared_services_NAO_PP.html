<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Whitehall attitude to computers 'like a virus', says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt">SOUTH NORFOLK MP 
  Richard Bacon has compared Whitehall&#8217;s attitude to information 
  technology to a computer virus, as a new report finds that a 
  contract to deliver a computer system for the Department for 
  Transport failed due to inadequate testing.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;Whitehall&#8217;s attitude to IT is like a computer 
  virus.&nbsp; It is spreading across government and it is infecting 
  departments&#8221;. </b>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The symptoms are the same every time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  First a department sets a ridiculously tight timetable for 
  implementation, then the system is not tested adequately.&nbsp; Once 
  relations with the supplier crash, then the virus is likely to prove 
  terminal&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;DEFRA has already been struck down with this 
  virus, as has HM Revenue and Customs.&nbsp; Last week we heard how badly the 
  NHS has been infected.&nbsp; Now the Department for Transport has been hit.&nbsp; 
  Whitehall needs to change radically its approach to IT, or this 
  infection will continue to spread&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office 
  published its report on shared services at the Department for Transport 
  (DfT) and its agencies.&nbsp; The report finds that the DfT used an existing 
  contract with IBM to deliver the IT systems needed to develop shared 
  services across the department.&nbsp;&nbsp; The report finds that the DfT set a 
  very demanding timetable for implementation and, as a consequence of the 
  drive to meet the timetable, users had insufficient time to test the 
  software.&nbsp; As a result, the IT system proved unstable. </p>
<p class="newsbody">The shared services programme was forecast to cost 
  &pound;55 million and achieve savings of &pound;112 million.&nbsp; The programme is 
  now forecast to cost over &pound;120 million and save just &pound;40 million.</p>
