<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">EU must take better care of our money, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has called on the 
  European Union (EU) to take greater care of taxpayers&#8217; money, as a new 
  report confirms that the European Union&#8217;s accounts have failed to be 
  signed off for the eleventh year in a row.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
  National Audit Office (NAO) published its report on the financial 
  management of the European Union.  In 2004, around 9,400 cases of irregularity and suspected 
  fraud with a value of &pound;663 million were reported to the EU&#8217;s anti-fraud 
  watchdog.&nbsp; Compared with 2003, the number of irregularities, including possible 
  fraud, increased by 12 per cent and their value increased by five per cent.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon, a member of both the Commons public accounts 
  committee, said today: &#8220;If the accounts of Marks &amp; 
  Spencer or Tesco had a qualified opinion from the auditors for even one year, 
  their directors would probably resign. &nbsp;Yet for the 
  eleventh consecutive year the accounts of the European Union have had a black 
  mark against them. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;British taxpayers have a right to expect high standards of 
  financial management and probity, whether their money is spent in the UK or in 
  Europe.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;EU 
  member states cannot even find the will to agree on ways of measuring fraud and 
  irregularity.&nbsp;  If the EU cannot safeguard the monies entrusted to it by 
  the taxpayers of this country, it is at least open to question whether they 
  should have them at all&#8221;.</p>
