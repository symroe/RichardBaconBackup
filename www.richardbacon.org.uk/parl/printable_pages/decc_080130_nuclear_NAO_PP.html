<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Nuclear clean-up costs 'out of control', says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has 
  said that the cost of cleaning up&nbsp; the UK's oldest nuclear reactors 
  is 'out of control', as a new report finds that the cost has increased 
  from &pound;61 billion to &pound;73 billion in just over two years. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The cost of cleaning up the UK&#8217;s first nuclear 
  reactors is running out of control.&nbsp; Just over two years ago the 
  estimated cost of cleaning up the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority&#8217;s 19 
  sites was &pound;61 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has now increased by &pound;12 billion to &pound;73 
  billion.&nbsp; What&#8217;s more, cost estimates for upcoming work kept on 
  increasing, even though they should have been agreed by now.&nbsp; The 
  Authority must find out why costs are increasing and bring them under 
  control&#8221;.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Sellafield is proving toxic for the Authority&#8217;s 
  finances, disrupting work at other sites and creating additional costs for the 
  taxpayer.&nbsp; The Authority needs to reduce the pressure that the work at 
  Sellafield is putting on its operations by cleaning up Sellafield as a matter of 
  priority&#8221;. </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, was speaking as the 
  National Audit Office published its report into the Nuclear Decommissioning 
  Authority&#8217;s programme to clean up the UK&#8217;s first generation of civil nuclear 
  facilities today (Wednesday 30 January 2008).&nbsp; The Nuclear Decommissioning 
  Authority owns a varied and ageing portfolio of 19 sites, including Magnox 
  nuclear power stations, research sites and the fuel handling, recycling and 
  production facilities at Sellafield.&nbsp; The report finds that the Authority&#8217;s 2007 
  estimate of the undiscounted future costs of sites over their remaining lifetime 
  (&pound;73 billion) was almost &pound;12 billion (18 per cent) higher than the estimate made 
  in 2005. The report also finds that cost estimates on work to be undertaken in 
  the near to medium-term, which might be expected to have stabilised by now, have 
  risen significantly over successive iterations. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Progress in decommissioning most Magnox and research sites 
  has been hampered by emerging pressures on the Authority&#8217;s financial position, 
  including the need to fulfil additional urgent expenditure commitments, 
  especially at Sellafield.&nbsp; As a result, &#8216;start-stop&#8217; decommissioning at these 
  sites has created significant uncertainty for site licensees and their 
  contractors, and have resulted in additional costs for the taxpayer*.</p>
<hr width="30%" size="1" color="#cccccc">
<p class="liltext">* - At the start of 2006-07 
the site and the Authority agreed that the project to build an Intermediate 
Level Waste Store at Hinkley Point A in Somerset, should be accelerated. Planned 
work on the project during 2006-07 was therefore increased from &pound;2.1 million to 
&pound;7.9 million. By the end of the year, however, the site had to cut back 
expenditure on the project. &nbsp;Work with a budget of &pound;0.4 million was removed from 
the 2006-07 programme and planned expenditure for 2007-08 was cut from &pound;6.0 
million to &pound;0.5 million. These cuts required the site to halt its contract for 
the store after the contractor had prepared the base for the store but had not 
started to construct its shell. Halting the contract was expected to bring 
demobilisation costs of some &pound;0.2 million and a similar level of cost is 
expected to be incurred in restarting the project.</p>
