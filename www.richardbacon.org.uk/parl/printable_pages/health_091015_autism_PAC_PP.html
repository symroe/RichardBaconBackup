									<p class="newsbody">Commenting on the Commons 
					public accounts committee&#8217;s report into the support given to 
					adults with autism, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member 
					of the committee, said:</span></font></p>
	<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;When young people with 
	autism reach adulthood, they often find themselves cut off from the support 
	provided to autistic children.&nbsp; They then become almost invisible to adult 
	health and social care services.&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
	<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;</span>Not enough is known 
	about the prevalence of autism and most NHS bodies and local authorities 
	have little idea of the numbers of people with autism in their area.&nbsp; As a 
	consequence, the needs of autistic people and their loved ones are rarely 
	taken into account and these families are falling through the gaps in 
	service provision.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></b></p>
	<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This needs to change.&nbsp; 
	Those providing health and social care services need a much better 
	understanding of autism so that they can provide effective and joined-up 
	support to autistic people and their families.&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
	<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This would make financial 
	sense as well as being more compassionate than the present approach, since 
	only 15 per cent of adults with autism are in full-time employment.&nbsp; There 
	are hundreds of thousands of adults with autism whose talents and potential 
	contribution are currently being wasted.&nbsp; It is wrong to write off people in 
	this way&#8221;.</span></font></b></p>
	<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public 
	accounts committee published its report into the support given to adults 
	with autism.&nbsp;&nbsp;The report finds that local 
	organisations do not currently have sufficient awareness of the number and 
	needs of people with autism in their area, limiting their ability to plan 
	effectively to provide services to this group. The transition of people with 
	autism from children&#8217;s to adult services is often poorly managed and 
	requires more effective leadership and relationships between services.</span></font></p>
	<p class="newsbody">The traditional configuration of health and 
	social care services has meant that adults with high-functioning autism may 
	fail to access appropriate support, potentially only doing so if they 
	develop more serious problems later. These problems can be exacerbated by 
	poor knowledge of autism amongst health and social care staff assessing the 
	needs of people with autism and their carers.</span></font></div>
