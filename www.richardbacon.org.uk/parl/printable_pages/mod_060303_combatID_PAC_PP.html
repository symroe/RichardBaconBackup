</p><br>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard 
  Bacon has called on the Ministry of Defence to double its efforts in 
  reducing the risk of the armed forces mistakenly firing on their own side 
  because of failure to identify them properly &#8211; so-called &#8216;friendly fire&#8217; - 
  as a new report finds that the Government&#8217;s progress in improving 
battlefield identification has been sluggish.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the 
  Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office 
  (NAO) published its report on Progress in Combat Identification today 
  (Friday 3 March 2006).&nbsp; The report was prompted by friendly fire deaths 
  during the 2003 Iraq war and finds that over half of the MoD&#8217;s Combat 
  Identification equipment projects have been delayed, deferred or cancelled.&nbsp; 
  60,000 cards were printed before the conflict to raise soldiers&#8217; awareness 
  of Combat Identification, but became lost in the supply chain before they 
  could reach front-line forces.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The MoD&#8217;s progress on 
  improving Combat Identification has been patchy.&nbsp; I find it troubling that 
  over half of the MoD&#8217;s Combat Identification projects have stalled or been 
  scrapped; particularly at a time when our armed forces in Iraq and 
  Afghanistan are deployed alongside allied nations in areas where there may 
  be large numbers of civilians.&nbsp; They need to have confidence not just in 
  their own training and equipment, but those of their coalition partners as 
  well.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The sad truth is that, 
  in terms of Combat Identification, the position of our armed forces has not 
  advanced significantly since the Iraq war.&nbsp; It does not help when one 
  measure for improving the situation gets swallowed up by the MoD&#8217;s asset 
  tracking problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;It will never be 
  possible to totally remove the risk of friendly-fire incidents, but the MoD 
  still needs to work harder with our allies to find viable solutions and 
  fulfil its duty of care to our servicemen and women.&nbsp; They have the right to 
  expect the MoD to spare no expense to avoid these needless deaths in 
  future&#8221;.</b></p>
