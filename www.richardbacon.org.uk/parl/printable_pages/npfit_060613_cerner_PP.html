<P class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">MP asks Health Secretary to block NHS 
IT contract</P>
<br>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
		Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, <a href="#three" class="tsb">has asked 
		health secretary Patricia Hewitt</a> to prevent British Telecom from 
		appointing Cerner as its new software supplier for NHS systems in 
London.</p>
<p class="newsbody">British Telecom is the main contractor for London in the NHS&#8217;s National Programme for IT, now called Connecting for Health.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said:  &#8220;Given the performance of Cerner so far in the South of England, it seems rather hasty to appoint the company as the main software subcontractor for the NHS IT programme in London. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;In the South of England, where Cerner were appointed last year to replace IDX, the company were due to be deploying 8 hospital care record systems by Easter 2006. Yet so far only one system has been deployed, at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, <a href="#two" class="tsb"><strong>which has led to serious problems</strong></a>. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The National Health Service should first see if <a href="#two" class="tsb"><strong>Cerner can deliver something which actually works</strong></a>. Indeed, it would make much more sense to allow individual NHS trusts to choose for themselves the software supplier they want, so long as there are common standards. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The main contractors such as British Telecom will not appoint major suppliers without the agreement of Connecting for Health, which is answerable to ministers, so this silly and rather hasty step can be prevented&#8221;. </p>

  <li class="liltext"><a name="one"></a>In December 2003 BT won a ten-year &pound;996 million contract to update IT systems 
    across London in the &pound;6.2 billion National Programme for IT in the health 
    service. British Telecom, which holds the main contract for updating NHS IT 
    systems in London, is understood to be close to reaching agreement to replace 
    its current software supplier IDX, owned by GE Healthcare (See also today&#8217;s 
    story &#8220;Cerner predicted to replace GE in London&#8221; in the leading health IT 
    news website E-Health Insider <a class="liltext_link_Blue" href="http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/item.cfm?ID=1937">here</a>. In the past 30 months BT has only implemented the IDX Carecast system at one 
    hospital trust in London, Queen Mary&#8217;s Hospital, Sidcup. Informed industry 
    sources believe that BT is on the verge of appointing Cerner as its new software 
    supplier for the London contract.</li>
  <br>
  <li class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none"><a name="two"></a>However, Cerner has also had difficulties in deploying systems into NHS 
    hospitals. Last year, Cerner were appointed as the main software subcontractor 
    to Fujitsu for the South of England cluster of the NHS&#8217;s national IT programme, 
    and by Easter 2006 were supposed to be deploying systems in 8 hospitals. So far 
    only one system has been deployed, at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford, an 
    installation which has caused significant difficulties. The Nuffield was obliged 
    to file a Serious Untoward Incident after its care record system went live. 
    Examples of serious untoward incidents include events which have or may have 
    caused death, serious injury, or are life-threatening, or contributed to a 
    pattern of reduced standard of care, or caused serious disruption to services.
