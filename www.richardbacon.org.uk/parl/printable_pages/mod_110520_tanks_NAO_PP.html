<h3 class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform:uppercase">Commenting  on </span>the National Audit Office report on the way that the Ministry of Defence has procured armoured vehicles, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said:</h3>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;It is an eloquent comment on the poor state of MOD procurement  that the most coherent acquisition process is the emergency one. &nbsp;The MoD spent &pound;2.8  billion on badly-needed armoured vehicles for Iraq and Afghanistan through its  &lsquo;Urgent Operational Requirements&rsquo; process.&nbsp; This spending was necessary  and successful, but when the right equipment at the right  price can only been obtained in a crisis, something has gone badly wrong&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;The  MoD has stopped so many armoured vehicle projects since 1998 that it will be  2024-25 before the UK&rsquo;s armed forces have all the vehicles they need.&nbsp;  Since 1998, &pound;718 million has been spent on armoured vehicle projects that have  been delayed, suspended or axed altogether.&nbsp; The MoD was determined that  its new armoured vehicles should be designed around the very latest  technologies, but such advanced technologies are still some way off and the  MoD&rsquo;s refusal to compromise on its vision of high-tech tanks has caused serious  delays.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;The  end result is that Britain&rsquo;s Armed Forces simply do not have the armoured  vehicles they were promised, even after a decade of waiting, and they are  unlikely to get them until 2024 at the earliest. If Britain&rsquo;s Armed Forces are  to be as capable, flexible and mobile as the Government wants, then the MoD  needs to get its act together and fast&rdquo;.</strong></p>
