    <p class="bwp4">Ministry of Justice &#8216;clueless' over community orders, says MP</p>
    <br>
    <p class="newsbody">SOUTH 
      NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has said that the Ministry of Justice is 
      &#8216;clueless&#8217; on community orders, as a new report finds the Ministry does not have basic information on the effectiveness of community orders.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The Ministry of Justice is clueless over the effectiveness of community orders.  The Ministry cannot say whether offenders are completing their orders or not and the most widely used measure of reoffending, the reconviction rate, does not include all offences committed within its two year monitoring period&#8221;. </b></p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b> &#8220;To add to the mess, the availability of community sentences 
      depends on where the offender lives, as do the rules governing 
      when offenders are deemed to have breached their orders&#8221;.</b></p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b> &#8220;Early signs are that community orders could be an effective 
      alternative to prison for some offenders but until Ministry of 
      Justice raises its game and gets the right information, it will 
      remain impossible to say whether or not community orders are 
      working&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"> Mr 
      Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee 
      published its report into the supervision of community orders in 
      England and Wales.&nbsp; <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The report finds that 
        sentences served in the community offer the courts a credible 
        alternative to custody.&nbsp; </span>Ministry of Justice figures 
      showed that the reconviction rates for community orders were 3.6 
      per cent below predicted rates, as opposed to 3.1 per cent below 
      predicted rates for custodial sentences. </p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"> However, the report also finds that the Ministry of Justice does 
      not have basic information on the effectiveness of community 
      orders, such as national data on whether offenders have 
      completed their community orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the most 
      widely used measure of reoffending, the reconviction rate, does 
      not include all offences committed in the two year monitoring 
      period and is not comprehensive enough to be a useful measure of 
      sentence effectiveness. </p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"> Although courts should be able to require offenders to complete 
      alcohol or drug treatment programmes, these are not available in 
      all local areas. There are also marked differences between 
      probation areas in their interpretation of acceptable and 
      unacceptable reasons for an offender breaching their community 
      order.</p>
