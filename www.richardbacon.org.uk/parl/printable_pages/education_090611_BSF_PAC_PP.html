		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the publication of the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report into the Building Schools for the Future programme, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:
<p class="newsbold">
		<b>
				&#8220;The aim of the Building Schools for the Future Programme (BSF) 
		is to help pupils get better results by rebuilding or refurbishing every 
  secondary school in the country.&nbsp;</p>



						<p class="newsbold">&#8220;This is certainly a worthwhile goal so it&#8217;s a pity that 
						this £55 billion programme has been untroubled by 
						reality at nearly every stage.&nbsp; From the start, poor 
						planning and persistent over-optimism created 
						expectations for BSF that were never going to be met.&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>
						
						&#8220;That&#8217;s why, of the 200 schools due to have been rebuilt 
						or refurbished by December 2008, only 42 were completed 
						on schedule.&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
						<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>
						
						&#8220;If the 
						government is now going to meet its revised target to 
						improve every school in England by 2023, then it needs 
						to build 250 schools a year from 2011 onwards.&nbsp; This is 
						an immense challenge, but neither the Department for 
						Children, Schools and Families nor Partnerships for 
						Schools seems to have grasped just how much has got to 
						be done. &nbsp; </b></p>
						<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>
						
						&#8220;The Department must look at this scheme in the 
						cold light of day and be honest about what can 
						realistically be achieved before this programme slips 
						further behind.&#8221;</span></font></b></p>
						<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">
						
						Mr Bacon was speaking as 
						the Commons public accounts committee published its 
						report into the Building Schools for the Future 
						programme.&nbsp; The Building 
						Schools for the Future Programme (BSF) plans to renew 
						every secondary school in the country, by rebuilding 
						half of them, structurally remodelling 35 per cent, 
						refurbishing 15 per cent and providing Information 
						Communication Technology to all.&nbsp; </p>
						<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">
						
						The Department for 
						Children, Schools and Families estimates that the 
						programme will cost £52&#8211;£55 billion over its lifetime 
						and aims is to use this capital investment as a catalyst 
						to improve educational outcomes.&nbsp; In 2004, the 
						Department established Partnerships for Schools to 
						manage the national delivery of the programme and 
						invited Partnerships UK, a joint venture between the 
						Treasury, Scottish Ministers and private companies with 
						an interest in public-private partnerships, to provide 
						advice and help manage Partnerships for Schools.</span></font></p>
						<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">
						
						The report finds that the 
						Department was over-optimistic in its original planning 
						assumptions for BSF, creating expectations for the speed 
						of delivery that could not be met. Of the 200 schools 
						originally planned to be completed by December 2008, 
						only 42 had been finished by that date. Although the 
						Department had hoped to deliver the programme over 10&#8211;15 
						years, it now expects it to take 18 years, with the last 
						school completed in 2023.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">
						
						The report also finds that 
						the Department and Partnerships for Schools appear 
						complacent about the challenge of renewing all secondary 
						schools by 2023.&nbsp; Meeting this target will require the 
						doubling of the number of schools in procurement and 
						construction, the construction of 250 schools a year 
						from 2011 onwards and the entry into BSF of eight or 
						nine local authorities a year.&nbsp; Current promises to 
						increase the pace of the programme are not sufficient to 
meet this. </p>
