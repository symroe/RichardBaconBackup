<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon raised the range of risks posed by Chinese lanterns at Prime Minister's Questions. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon told the Commons that the lanterns, which are  mostly constructed from bamboo, wire and paper and act like mini hot-air balloons,  pose dangers to livestock, buildings and crops.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">When lanterns released into the sky in rural areas come down in farmers' fields, their wire frames can be accidentally cut into small pieces by harvesting equipment and then incorporated into animal feed such as hay and silage, potentially causing massive internal injuries to the animal.   There is also a risk that the burning wick inside could start fires in crops or buildings.  A number of such fires have occurred, in some cases costing farmers thousands of pounds in lost crops. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> </b>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, standing in for Prime  Minister David Cameron, responded that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills had been in  contact with the manufacturers of the lanterns and has demanded that the  lanterns in future should be 100 per cent biodegradable and should have full  safety instructions with them. </p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;Chinese  lanterns pose a threat to farmers both because of the fire risk to standing  crops when lanterns fall into fields and because the wire frames are cut into  small pieces by harvesting equipment so that wire is incorporated into animal  feed such as hay and silage, killing farm animals. </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;I know that many  people take pleasure from seeing these lanterns in the sky and nobody wants to  be a killjoy, but the risks currently posed by lanterns are serious and it is  good news that the Government is taking action on this issue to reduce some of the  potential dangers&rdquo;.</strong></p>
