<h3 class="newsbody"> COMMENTING ON the publication of the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report on HM Revenue & Customs&#8217; control and facilitation of imports, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:</h3>
<p class="newsbody" > <b> &#8220;HM Revenue &amp; 
  Customs (HMRC) aims to prevent illegal imports, such as drugs and 
  firearms, from being imported into the country.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;HMRC does this by checking 
  traders&#8217; documents and undertaking audits of traders at their 
  premises.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;HMRC sought to 
  speed up the clearance of imports at the UK frontier by cutting the 
  number of physical examinations and increasing its document checks.&nbsp; 
  However, despite rising imports, the number of documentary checks 
  fell from 15.9 per cent in 2003-04 to 5.5 per cent in 2007-08. </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;The 
  UK also erroneously reported a physical examination rate of 0.1 per 
  cent, one of the lowest in the EU.&nbsp; Although the actual rate is 
  likely to be between 2 and 3 per cent, this is still much lower than 
  the EU average of 9 per cent.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;What&#8217;s more, when HMRC centralised 
  its document checking into one operations hub in 2007, only one in 
  five of its staff had any experience of customs work and, a year 
  later, it was discovered that 18 per cent of the hub&#8217;s document 
  checks had errors.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;HMRC is supposed 
  to stop guns, drugs and other contraband from being smuggled through 
  the UK frontier but its management of border checks has been 
  downright sloppy.&nbsp; This could potentially be putting the UK at risk 
  and HM Revenue &amp; Customs needs to do much better in future.&#8221;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons 
  public accounts committee published its report on HM Revenue &amp; 
  Customs&#8217; control and facilitation of imports.&nbsp; HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) controls imports by checking 
  traders&#8217; documents, physically examining goods at the frontier, and 
  undertaking audits of traders at their premises. In April 2008, the 
  UK Border Agency assumed responsibility for carrying out the 
  physical examinations of goods at the frontier.&nbsp; To speed up 
  clearance of imports at ports, HMRC aimed to limit the number of 
  physical checks carried out at the border and shift its controls 
  more towards documentary checks and trader audits.&nbsp; Although 
  consignments increased by 19 per cent from 3.4 million to 4.1 
  million between 2003&#8211;04 and 2007&#8211;08, the proportion of documentary 
  checks fell from 15.9 per cent to 5.5 per cent over the same period.</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> In 2007, the Department reported to 
  the EU that its rate of physical examination was 0.1 per cent of all 
  goods imported from outside the EU. However, this rate was based on 
  just 200 imports selected for checking by HMRC each month using its 
  main trade system and excluded other examinations selected as a 
  result of detection officers reviewing cargo and manifest 
  information. &nbsp;The National Audit Office examined the data from April 
  to September 2008 and identified gaps and inconsistencies in 
  recording. &nbsp;The data suggested that, on average, the total 
  examination rate was between 2 and 3 per cent of imports, still 
  lower than the average EU examination rate of 9 per cent.<font face="MinionPro-Regular"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: MinionPro-Regular">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> HMRC centralised its documentary 
  checks to its National Clearance Hub in 2007 but, when the Hub was 
  established, only 30 of the 150 staff had previous customs 
  experience and a review in February 2008 revealed that 18 per cent 
  of checks had an error. The Department subsequently concluded that 
  no goods had been imported that should not have been, because the 
  errors were largely in the administrative processes, such as 
  recording the time or date incorrectly.
