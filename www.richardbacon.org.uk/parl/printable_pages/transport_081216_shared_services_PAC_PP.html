<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon, a 
  member of the Commons public accounts committee, has said the 
  Department for Transport&#8217;s scheme to share corporate services 
  across its agencies involved &#8216;classic Whitehall cock-ups&#8217; that 
  could and should have been avoided.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said: 
  &#8220;The 
  Department&#8217;s mistakes were classic Whitehall cock-ups that could 
  and should have been avoided.&nbsp; &nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;We saw the 
  failure to test computer systems adequately with tax credits and 
  with the Passport Agency. We saw the failure to have somebody 
  clearly in overall charge with the National Probation Service 
  computer system and with the radio communication system for the 
  armed forces.&nbsp; These were well-known bear-traps but the 
  Department for Transport blundered straight into them.&nbsp; It is 
  way past time that Whitehall learned to stop making the same old 
  mistakes again and again.&#8221; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee 
  published its report into the Department for Transport&#8217;s scheme 
  to share corporate services with its agencies.&nbsp; The report finds that the Department for 
  Transport (DfT) took shortcuts which subsequently caused 
  computer problems. The DfT did not specify its requirements 
  precisely enough or manage its suppliers sufficiently closely. 
  It also reduced the time available for testing the system and, 
  as a consequence, the shared service system was unstable from 
  the moment it was switched on.&nbsp; Users of the system have little 
  confidence in its abilities and, in some cases, the service is 
  worse than that previously provided.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The Department initially estimated 
  that the Programme would yield a net benefit of &pound;57 million over 
  the first 10 years. However, current forecasts show that the 
  Programme will now incur a net cost of &pound;81 million.&nbsp; </p>
