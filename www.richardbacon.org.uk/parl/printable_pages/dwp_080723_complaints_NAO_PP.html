five complaints</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
  Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee has said that 
  the Department of Work and Pensions could be missing early warnings of 
  poor service, because it only records one in five of the complaints it 
  receives.&nbsp; 
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said:&nbsp;&ldquo;Last year, the Department for Work and 
  Pensions only recorded one in five of the complaints it received&#8221;</p>
    <p class="newsbold">&ldquo;These complaints may have been addressed quickly and easily, but 
      they could also have provided a warning of more serious problems ahead.&nbsp; 
      By not recording them, the Department may well be missing the bigger 
      picture.</p>
    <p class="newsbold">&ldquo;The DWP needs to get better at recording 
      complaints&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office 
      (NAO) published its report into how the Department for Work and Pensions 
      (DWP) and its agencies handle the complaints they receive.&nbsp;
    <p class="newsbody">The report finds that a potentially large volume of 
      complaints are dealt with but not recorded. &nbsp;
    <p class="newsbody">Consequently the DWP and its agencies could miss 
      early warnings of poor services, systematic errors, or problems with its 
      processes. &nbsp;</p>
