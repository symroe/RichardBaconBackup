<p class="newsbody"><strong><i>No increase in removal of failed asylum seekers 
under new asylum system </i></strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon, a member of 
  the Commons public accounts committee, has warned that the UK 
  Border Agency&#8217;s new asylum system is failing, as a report by the 
  National Audit Office finds that there has been no increase in 
  the removal of failed asylum applicants from the UK and that, in 
  the last 12 months, the backlog of asylum applications has 
  doubled.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The UK Border Agency&#8217;s New Asylum Model 
  has not increased the number of failed asylum seekers removed 
  from the UK at all and its backlog of asylum applications has 
  doubled in the last 12 months.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&#8220;The Agency has also failed to 
  use 10,000 emergency travel documents supplied by foreign 
  governments for asylum cases, despite the fact that 70 per cent 
  are for cases where there is no reason why the failed applicant 
  should not be removed.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&#8220;What&#8217;s more, nearly 10 per cent of these 
  documents have expired and 13 per cent are for applicants who 
  have since absconded.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&#8220;The UK Border Agency has failed to 
  improve the management of asylum applications.&nbsp; The New Asylum 
  Model has not improved the lot of genuine asylum seekers and nor 
  has it ensured the speedy removal of failed ones.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&#8220;Frankly, it 
  is a failure and the UK Border Agency needs to get its act 
  together.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit 
  Office published its report into the UK Border Agency&#8217;s 
  management of asylum applications.&nbsp; The report finds that the New Asylum Model has not yet 
  resulted in an increase in the removal of failed asylum 
  applicants and that the backlog of asylum decisions to be made 
  has more than doubled in over a year to 8,700 in the second 
  quarter of 2008.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">The report also finds that the UK Border 
  Agency had applied for and been offered up to 13,000 Emergency 
  Travel Documents by overseas governments which it has not used, 
  10,000 of them for Asylum cases. Of the 10,000 potentially 
  available documents, over 7,000 are related to cases for which 
  there are no remaining barriers that should prevent the 
  applicant from being removed. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Of the 10,000, however, 987 (10 
  per cent) have expired and cannot be used without revalidation 
  and 1,465 (15 per cent) are in the process of being used and 
  removal action is being taken, 1,263 (13 per cent) have been 
  granted Asylum and 1,338 (13 per cent) have absconded. </p>
