<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">IT &#8216;Big Bang&#8217; left CSA broken, says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has called on officials to learn from a scathing report by the National Audit Office on the failure of the programme to reform the Child Support Agency (CSA). </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:5pt; text-autospace: none"> Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into the way the CSA&#8217;s 2003 reform programme was implemented.  
<p class="newsbody"> Three years after the &pound;0.5 billion CSA reform programme, was introduced, the 
  Agency&#8217;s performance has still not improved.&nbsp; The programme was intended to 
  start in March 2002, but was delayed by a year because the new IT system, CS2, 
  had not been fully tested.&nbsp; By the time the system was introduced a year later, 
  CS2 had developed 14 critical defects.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="newsbody">There are 
    still some 500 faults with CS2 and 36,000 new cases are currently &#8216;stuck&#8217; in the 
    system because of IT failures.&nbsp; Over 60 per cent of the CSA&#8217;s caseload has not 
    benefited from the reforms and the CSA has recognised it did not have the 
    resources to check effectively the system that EDS was delivering.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon 
    said today: &#8220;The 
    Child Support reforms have cost a great deal more than expected and achieved a 
    great deal less than hoped.&nbsp; The Child Support Agency was already 
    underperforming and overstretched when officials took the nuclear option and 
    decided to bring in new IT systems whilst simultaneously making huge structural 
    changes to the way the agency worked.&nbsp; This was a recipe for disaster&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
  <p class="newsbold">&#8220;When the 
    dust settled from this &#8216;big bang&#8217;, it was discovered that the reforms had made 
    matters far worse.&nbsp; For example, it now costs the CSA 70p to collect every &pound;1 of 
    maintenance.&nbsp; Small wonder government support for single parents and their 
    children has become little short of a bad joke&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-right:0pt;text-align:justify"><b>&#8220;It is 
    clear that officials fell for EDS&#8217;s sales patter and had no means to check 
    whether EDS were delivering what was promised.&nbsp; Officials must learn from this 
    report and take a more cautious approach to IT in future, but the damage is 
    already done and many thousands of families have been left facing serious 
    hardship as a result&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
