		<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on </span>the publication of the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report on the Cabinet Office&#8217;s programme of bi-annual Capability Reviews, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said: </p>
		<p class="newsbold"> &#8220;The Capability 
		  Reviews are a very useful tool in bringing transparency to 
		  Whitehall and showing whether government departments are fit for 
		  purpose.&nbsp; However, the reviews still need some work if they 
		  are to drive real improvement.
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Too many of 
		    the judgements in the review process are subjective and there 
		    are few external benchmarks, even though studying success 
		    elsewhere in the private and public sectors can only help drive 
		    forward improvements.&nbsp; Senior civil servants often seem able to 
		    get away with mistakes that would cost most people their jobs.&nbsp; 
		    Capability Reviews need to drive a much stronger culture of 
		    performance management, with sanctions for failure starting at 
		    retraining and ending in dismissal if necessary. </b>
        <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;Capability 
          Reviews are not perfect but they must continue and the Cabinet 
          Secretary, Sir Gus O&#8217;Donnell, is to be commended for driving 
          this valuable process through.&nbsp; However, Sir Gus can only 
          guarantee that the reviews will continue whilst he is at the 
          helm. &nbsp;&nbsp;It would be unfortunate if they were to be quietly 
          shelved once Sir Gus steps down.&#8221;&nbsp; </b></p>
        <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
          Commons public accounts committee published its report on the 
          Cabinet Office&#8217;s programme of bi-annual Capability Reviews.&nbsp; In 2005, the Cabinet 
          Secretary launched a programme of bi-annual Capability Reviews. 
          They involve published external assessments of departments with 
          the aim of achieving a major improvement in civil service 
          capability. The programme is a significant step forward in how 
          government departments are assessed and, to have publicly 
          available commentary, potentially critical, of departments&#8217; 
          capability is a real driver for improvement.</p>
        <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> The report finds that there need 
          to be improvements to the metrics used to establish a clear link 
          between departments&#8217; capability and performance, as improving 
          departments&#8217; capability and performance requires a much wider 
          range of objective quantitative measures than Capability Reviews 
          currently use and publish. &nbsp;&nbsp;Benchmarking against the best 
          private and public sector organisations is also a key driver of 
          improvement and the report finds that there need to be 
          quantitative external benchmarks against which departments&#8217; 
          capability and performance are assessed. 
        <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> The report also 
          identifies that there needs to be a much stronger culture of 
          individual performance management, clearly linked to 
          departments&#8217; overall delivery metrics. Incentives and sanctions 
          to reflect success and tackle failure are weaker in the civil 
          service than in the private sector and in senior levels of local 
          government. Good performance needs to be recognised and suitably 
          rewarded.</p>
