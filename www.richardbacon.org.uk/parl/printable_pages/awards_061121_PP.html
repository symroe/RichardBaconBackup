		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has received  
		four prestigious political awards for his work in parliament.
The Spectator magazine named him as 'Parliamentarian of the Year' for what it described as 'his exemplary use of parliamentary procedure' to expose the foreign prisoners scandal. Former winners of this award 
have included Tony Blair, John Major and Edward Heath.<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
Mr Bacon has also been announced as 'Parliamentarian of the Year' by the Political 
Studies Association and additionally received the award for 'Outstanding Parliamentarian of the Year' from&nbsp; 
the Conservativehome website, again for his exposure of the foreign prisoners 
scandal, which led to the sacking of former Home Secretary Charles Clarke.&nbsp; &nbsp;   
			
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Earlier this year, Mr Bacon was named as 'Backbencher of the Year' in the parliamentary House 
		Magazine annual awards.</p>
			
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon expressed regret that his probing had cost Mr Clarke, a 
		fellow Norfolk MP, his job and said today: 

</p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;Whilst 
		I am pleased to have helped bring to light the scandal of foreign 
		prisoners being released rather than deported, I do regret that it cost Charles Clarke, 
		a fellow Norfolk MP, his job&#8221;.&nbsp; </b>

</p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;I have a great deal 
		of respect for Charles and my questioning of the Home Office over 
		foreign prisoners was 'business not pleasure'&#8221;. </b>
