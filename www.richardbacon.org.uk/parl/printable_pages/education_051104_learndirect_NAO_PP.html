<p class="bwp4">MP fears for rural learndirect services</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform:uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has called on the Department for Education and Skills to ensure 
  that the 'learndirect' initiative, set up to support adults who have no formal 
  qualifications, will continue to be run in rural areas.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, 
  was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into 
  learndirect today (Friday 4 November, 2005). Whilst learndirect has been 
  successful in attracting reluctant learners, it has not become as 
  self-sufficient as intended.&nbsp; Although Ufi changed its funding model to address 
  this, doubt was cast over the long-term viability of some of learndirect's 2,400 
  centres.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Ufi, the public-private partnership behind learndirect, has 
  received &pound;930 million in education funding since its creation in 1998.&nbsp; The 
  report finds that almost 30 per cent of its budget went on management and 
  marketing in 2004-05, but that these high overhead costs should now be reduced.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon said: &quot;I am very concerned that if Ufi's network of learndirect centres proves to be unsustainable, rural areas will suffer most. &nbsp;Ufi 
  has already begun to make savings and the NAO has identified where more are 
  possible.&nbsp; I would urge the Department to work with Ufi to make these savings as 
  quickly as possible and ensure there is no loss of rural provision&quot;. </p>
