<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Computers too modern for 
ramshackle military bases, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has said that 
  the UK's military bases are too ramshackle to support a new computer system, as a report finds that 
  the MoD was too optimistic about the physical condition of many defence sites.
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: 
  &#8220;The Defence Information Infrastructure programme was supposed 
  to link military units to MoD headquarters via a single computer 
  system&#8221;.</p>
  <p class="newsbold">&#8220;However, the MoD didn&#8217;t think about 
    how a high-tech computer network would fit into ramshackle military 
    bases and many sites did not have rooms suitable for modern IT 
    equipment&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="newsbold">&#8220;You would have thought that, after buying 
    radios that wouldn&#8217;t fit in the Army&#8217;s vehicles, the MoD would have 
    learned to look at where new kit is going to be fitted before 
    installing it.&nbsp; Clearly it hasn&#8217;t&#8221;.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit 
    Office published its report into the Defence Information 
    Infrastructure (DII) programme.&nbsp; In 2005, 
    the Ministry of Defence (MoD) awarded a 10-year contract worth an 
    estimated &pound;4.9 billion to ATLAS, a consortium led by EDS.&nbsp; The 
    contract will replace the MoD&#8217;s diverse computer systems with a 
    single information infrastructure, deploying 150,000 terminals at 
    over 2,000 defence sites, including on ships and deployed 
    operations.
  <p class="newsbody">The report finds that the DII programme&#8217;s 
    evaluation of the average physical condition of defence sites was 
    too optimistic and no formal pilot of the installation process was 
    undertaken.&nbsp; Assumptions about the availability of up-to-date site 
    plans and statutory Health and Safety documentation, including 
    asbestos and power supply surveys, were incorrect.&nbsp; At many sites, 
    the MoD struggled to find rooms suitable for DII network and server 
    equipment. &nbsp;
  <p class="newsbody">In order to introduce the new Bowman 
    family of digital radios, 20,000 land vehicles had to be converted 
    to carry the system. &nbsp;However, poor data on the MoD&#8217;s heavily 
    modified vehicle fleet meant that conversion was both slower than 
    anticipated and more expensive.&nbsp;
