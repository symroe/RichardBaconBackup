</p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on </span>the National Audit Office report on the Department for Work and Pensions&#8217; communications with its customers, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said:
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The Department for Work and Pensions has made some progress in reducing 
  the number and length of its benefit application forms, but many forms 
  are still too long.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b>&#8220;The Department can do much more to make applying for benefits easier.  For example, some applicants using paper forms still receive long and complex guidance notes, which mostly do not have simple &#8216;getting started&#8217; guides.  The system-generated letters sent to older customers requesting more information in support of Pension Credit applications are long and confusing.  Furthermore, the Department could do much more to exchange information with customers online.&#8221; </b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into the Department for Work and Pensions&#8217; communications with its customers.  The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has significantly changed the way in which it provides information in recent years with a growth in online provision.  The report finds that, despite this growth, paper forms still remain unnecessarily long and guidance notes are also still too complicated.    Charities and non-governmental organisations told the NAO said that simplified starting off instructions were badly needed because almost no one read the guidance notes provided by the Department until and unless they got stuck.
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">The report also finds that system-generated letters sent to older customers requesting additional information in support of Pension Credit applications are long and confusing.
    
    
    
    Cost efficiencies from online provision have still to be realised fully and, although forms can be downloaded from the internet, it is not yet possible to apply for most benefits online.  More efficiency gains from online provision are possible, but investment in the new systems necessary is expected to take a number of years. </p>
