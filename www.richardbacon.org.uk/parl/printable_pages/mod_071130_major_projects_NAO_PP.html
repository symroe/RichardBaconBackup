<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has 
  said that the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s efforts to cut the cost of 
  procurement is having an impact on the frontline, as a new report finds that 
  the MoD has chose to tackle cost increases by ordering less kit, 
  reducing its capability or delaying its delivery.</span></p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8216;The MoD&#8217;s attempts to keep a lid on cost increases 
  are being felt on the front line as vital equipment is either cut back 
  or delayed.&#8221;.</p>
<p class="newsbold"> &#8220;Our troops are under huge pressures and yet are 
  continuing to pay the price for the MoD&#8217;s inefficiencies. This 
  is unacceptable&#8221;. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking 
  as the National Audit Office published its report into the 
  Ministry of Defence&#8217;s 20 largest military equipment projects.&nbsp; 
  The report finds that in order to limit cost increases the MoD 
  has delayed delivery dates, reduced equipment capability or cut 
  the quantities of equipment ordered.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The MoD has cut the number of 
  anti-aircraft missiles being ordered for the Type 45 Destroyer, 
  which is intended to form the backbone of the Royal Navy&#8217;s air 
  defences.&nbsp; The MoD has also cut back on communications equipment 
  for the A400M transport plane and delayed the building of a 
  training facility for A400M pilots.&nbsp; </p>
