<p class="bwp4">Rural learning must be cost effective, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has called on Learndirect, an 
  adult learning partnership, to look at making more use of technology to deliver 
  cost-effective adult learning programmes in rural areas, as a new report finds 
  that Learndirect centres in rural areas are finding it difficult to make ends 
  meet.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts 
  committee published its report today on the Learndirect services provided by 
  public-private partnership Ufi today (Tuesday 7 March 2006).&nbsp; The report finds 
  that the provision of services in rural areas is likely to benefit from 
  investment in new technology and that the cost of running Learndirect centres in 
  rural areas with low population density is posing difficulties for Ufi.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;Smaller Learndirect centres, particularly those in rural 
  areas, are struggling.&nbsp; The advent of broadband and the falling price of PCs 
  have made the need to attend any kind of learning centre less important.&nbsp; Ufi 
  might serve rural communities better by investing in delivering home-learning 
  packages over the internet, rather than keeping learning centres open when they 
are not economically viable&#8221;.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Rural provision of Learndirect courses could also 
  benefit greatly by making use of the many excellent village halls and community 
  centres that counties like Norfolk have to offer.&nbsp; There is much that Ufi can do 
  to bridge the gap between what rural learners need and what Learndirect can 
  cost-effectively offer&#8221;.</b></p>
