<p class="bwp4">Hospitals must buy smarter, says Bacon</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">COMMENTING ON the publication of the National Audit Office&rsquo;s  report into the procurement of consumables by NHS acute and Foundation trusts, South  Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee,  said:

<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;The way in which NHS hospitals buy basic supplies is in a muddle,  potentially wasting &pound;500 million through incoherent and uneven procurement.</p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Hospital trusts do not know nearly enough about the  supplies they are buying, from whom they are buying or where savings might be  made.&nbsp; Many hospital Trusts are spending more than they need to because  they are ordering many different types of the same product.&nbsp; 61 hospital trusts bought 21 different types of A4 paper,  652 different types of surgical and examination gloves and 1,751 different  cannulas. &nbsp;It is clear that hospitals could save money if they got  together when buying basic items.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Hospital trusts could also save money by buying in bulk  rather than making frequent, small purchases of items like A4 paper, which  incurs high administration costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation Trusts have the power  to manage their affairs as they see fit, but trust managers are responsible for  proving that they have achieved value for money.&nbsp; They will not be able to  hide behind the Department for Health if this situation fails to improve.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;At a time when NHS budgets are under enormous pressure, hospital trusts must  look very seriously at any opportunity to make savings&rdquo;.</strong></p>
