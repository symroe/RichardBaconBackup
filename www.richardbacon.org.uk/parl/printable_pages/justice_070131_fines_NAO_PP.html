<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">MP wants fined offenders to pay on time</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">SOUTH 
  NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has called on magistrates courts to ensure that 
  offenders who receive a fine as part of their sentence pay up 
  immediately, as a new report finds that only 5 per cent of offenders pay 
  their fine on the day it is set.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> Although guidance to magistrates states that fines are payable immediately, a review by the National Audit Office found that magistrates only asked seven per cent of offenders for immediate payment and only five per cent actually paid their fine at all. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Devon and Cornwall magistrates make a point of telling offenders that their fine is due immediately and although only 10 per cent of offenders pay up front, this is still twice the average achieved elsewhere.</p>
<p 
  class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said today:&nbsp; &#8220;Fines are due the moment they are 
  set, not at an offender&#8217;s convenience.&nbsp; Something is going seriously 
  wrong when the best performing magistrates only make ten per cent of 
  offenders pay their fine on the day of the trial. &nbsp;Magistrates must 
  ensure offenders pay up straightaway and only offer lenient terms in 
  cases of real, proven hardship&#8221;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">The report also finds the Department for 
  Constitutional Affairs (DCA) lacks basic information about offenders, 
  such as how many offenders pay their fine.&nbsp; LIBRA, the DCA&#8217;s delayed 
  computer system, was supposed to hold this information but LIBRA may not 
  be rolled out until March 2008.&nbsp; Yet the current LIBRA contracts are due 
  to end in early 2007, and the DCA has already put out two tenders for 
  the system&#8217;s replacement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon added: &#8220;Delivering the LIBRA system 
  would have made the imposition and collection of fines much easier but 
  unfortunately the system has been hopelessly delayed and if LIBRA ever 
  flickers into life it will be only just in time to be replaced&#8221;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
