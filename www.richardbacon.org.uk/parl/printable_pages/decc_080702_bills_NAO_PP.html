<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">We can do more to cut energy bills, says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase"> <font face="Arial">South Norfolk</font></span> MP Richard Bacon says 
  more can be done to save energy, as a new report finds that the typical 
  household could save at least &pound;280 if energy-savings measures already 
available were more widely adopted. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;Energy prices are rising at an 
  uncomfortable rate and we could be doing much more to save both energy 
and money.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;If homeowners took up all the energy-saving 
  measures available, such as improved heating controls and better loft 
  insulation, this could cut energy bills by 30 per cent and save at least 
  &pound;280.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Homeowners lose &pound;40 a year by leaving appliances 
  on standby mode and businesses are counting the cost too.&nbsp; An office 
  computer and laser printer left on standby overnight and at weekends 
  will cost a business &pound;41 a year.&nbsp; A photocopier left on standby costs 
&pound;42 a year.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Cutting the cost of living and working has to be 
  a good thing.&nbsp; There is plenty we can all do to bring our energy bills 
down&#8221;.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts 
  committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office published its 
  report into reducing household energy consumption.&nbsp; The report finds that a typical UK household could save 
  about 30 per cent of its energy bills if it adopted available energy 
  saving measures, including loft and cavity wall insulation, and improved 
  heating controls.&nbsp; The report also finds that 71 per cent of people 
  leave appliances on &#8216;standby&#8217;.&nbsp; </p>
