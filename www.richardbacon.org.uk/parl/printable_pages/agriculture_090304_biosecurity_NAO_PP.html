				<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
				<span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on </span>the National Audit Office report on the health of livestock and honeybees, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said:
</p>
				<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">
				<b>&#8220;Unless serious diseases affecting farm animals are brought under control quickly, they pose significant threats to human health, animal welfare, the economy and the environment.  
				The economic consequences are also devastating for 
					individual farmers and their families.&#8221;&nbsp; </b></p>

					<p class="newsbody"><b>
					
					&#8220;When 
					animal diseases strike, farmers need the rapid support of 
						Defra and its agencies, but all too often Defra&#8217;s right hand 
					doesn&#8217;t know what its left hand is doing.&nbsp; Common standards 
					on biosecurity would help farmers minimise the risk of 
					animal diseases spreading but it is also important that 
					Defra works with farmers to agree practical and achievable 
					standards.&#8221;</b></p>
					<p class="newsbody"><b>
					
					&#8220;The 
					importance of protecting the UK&#8217;s honeybees cannot be 
					overstated, as we depend on these creatures to pollinate 
					crops.&nbsp; Honeybees have been hit hard by parasites and 
					disease in recent years, but Defra still lacks a complete 
					picture of the situation.&#8221;&nbsp; </b></p>
					<p class="newsbody"><b>
					
					&#8220;I urge any 
					beekeepers who are not known to the National Bee Unit to 
					register and inform the Unit of any disease outbreaks.&#8221;</b></p>
					<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">
					Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
					National Audit Office published its report into the health 
					of livestock and honeybees.&nbsp; 
					The report finds that there are no national standards on 
					farm biosecurity to minimise the risk of diseases spreading 
					and that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
					Affairs (Defra) Animal Health and other inspection bodies 
					do not systematically collect and share information about biosecurity risks, even though more effective planning and 
					collaborative working would enable better control of endemic 
					disease. </p>
					<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify">
					The report also finds that 
					beekeepers have reported unusually high losses of honeybees 
					in recent years.&nbsp; The Varroa parasite is now endemic, making 
					honeybee colonies more vulnerable to other diseases. 
					Effective control of Varroa and monitoring of other diseases 
					is hampered by the fact that an estimated 20,000 beekeepers 
					are not known to the National Bee Unit&#8217;s inspectors and are 
					less likely to notify the Department of any diseases. </p>
