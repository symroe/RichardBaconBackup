10 times more houses than it built, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has said that a programme to renew declining neighbourhoods risks leaving demolition sites as its legacy, as a new report finds that the scheme has demolished ten times more houses than it has built.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The Housing Market Renewal Programme is attempting to transform 
  derelict neighbourhoods by demolishing derelict housing and building new 
  homes.&nbsp; However, the programme has so far demolished ten times more houses than it has built&#8221;. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The government must make sure that this programme&#8217;s legacy is renewed neighbourhoods and not rubble&#8221;. </p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report into the Housing Market Renewal Programme.  The Housing Market Renewal Programme aims to tackle the problems of deprived and declining neighbourhoods with a range of measures, including replacing obsolete property with new buildings. </p>
<p class="newsbody">However, although 10,000 homes have been demolished so far, only 1,000 new houses have been built. </p>
