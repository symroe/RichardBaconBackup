<br>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on </span>the National Audit Office&#8217;s report into the support given to adults with autism, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said: </p>
<p class="newsbody"> <b> &#8220;Autism and autistic spectrum disorders such 
  as Asperger Syndrome may affect up to 1 per cent of the population.&#8221;</b> <b>&#8220;However, because so little is known about the 
    prevalence of autism, those affected by autistic spectrum disorders have 
    been left all but invisible to health and social care services. &nbsp;Most 
    NHS bodies and local authorities have little idea of the numbers of 
    people with autism in their area.&nbsp; As a consequence, the needs of 
    autistic people and their families are rarely taken into account.&#8221; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;This needs to change.&nbsp; 
  Those providing health and social care services need a much better 
  understanding of autism so that they can provide effective and joined-up 
  support to autistic people and their families.&#8221;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="bwp6"><em><u> The 
  Situation in Norfolk</u></em><br>
  <span class="newsbold" style="text-align: justify">Mr Bacon added: &#8220;In 
    Norfolk, I have been approached in recent years by a number of parents 
    whose adult sons are autistic or have Asperger Syndrome and who have 
    found great difficulties in obtaining suitable help from local health 
and social care services.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;Far too often, these parents have found that 
  they &#8216;fell between two stools&#8217; and that the council simply did not offer 
  services which met their needs.&nbsp; I put several of these mothers in touch 
  with each other and for over two years they have now been having regular 
  meetings with Norfolk County Council&#8217;s Adult Social Services 
  Department.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is now a steering group of parents, local support 
  groups such as Asperger East Anglia and Autism Anglia and council 
  officials who have all been working together to develop services which 
  make sense and actually address the problems which this group of people 
  face.&#8221;</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"><b> &#8220;Getting to this point 
  has proved difficult.&nbsp; It has taken several years of prodding and 
  cajoling before Norfolk County Council admitted there was a gap in its 
  provision of services.&nbsp; I am pleased to say that the County Council is 
  now responding and we are seeing signs of progress locally.&nbsp; This is in 
  no small measure due to the persistence of parents and local support 
  groups.&nbsp; They are a determined and inspiring group but until local 
  health and social care professionals are better trained in recognising 
  the needs of autistic people and their families, much of the hard work 
  will continue to rest on their shoulders.&#8221;&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the National 
  Audit Office published its report into the support given to adults with 
  autism.&nbsp;&nbsp;The report finds that most NHS 
  organisations and local authorities do not know how many people with 
  autism there are in the areas they serve, and three quarters of local 
  authorities do not have a specific commissioning strategy for adults 
  with autism. &nbsp;They also lack a full understanding and awareness of the 
  condition, limiting their ability to plan and deliver services 
  effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify"> The report also finds that GPs and social 
  care staff have low awareness of autism and how to diagnose it, with 80 
  per cent of GPs surveyed reporting that they need additional guidance 
  and training in order to identify and treat patients with autism more 
  effectively.&nbsp; </p>
