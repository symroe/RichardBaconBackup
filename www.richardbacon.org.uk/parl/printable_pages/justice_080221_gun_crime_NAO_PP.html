<h3>Firmer action needed on gun crime, says MP</h3>
  <p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
    Bacon has called for firmer action on gun crime, as a new report finds 
    that violent crime involving a firearm doubled between 1998-99 and 
    2005-06.&nbsp; 
  <p class="newsbody" > <b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;Gun crime is becoming a more and more worrying problem.&nbsp; The government should be taking much firmer action to deal with gun crime.&nbsp; 
    They now have a plan to establish a ballistic analysis system to link 
    firearms to individual crimes, but you have to wonder why on earth this 
    wasn&#8217;t this being done already?</b>
  <p class="newsbody" ><b>&#8220;American law enforcement agencies have been 
    using such a system for over a decade&#8221;.&nbsp; </b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, was speaking as the National Audit Office published its report on reducing the risk of violent crime today.&nbsp; Over the period 
    1998-99 to 2005-06, recorded crimes involving a firearm more than 
    doubled from 5,200 to 11,100 and, although this fell to 9,700 in 
    2006-07, <a href="#hof" class="tsb">Home Office figures</a> show that gun deaths rose by 18 per 
    cent the same year.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody"> The 
    Home Office is seeking to make it easier to track gun usage by 
    introducing a national ballistics analysis system which will use 
    forensic analysis to link weapons to individual crimes. In the 
    United States, Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies 
    have used the Integrated Ballistic Identification System (IBIS) since 1993 to 
    record and compare gun crime evidence.&nbsp; In that time, IBIS has 
    recorded over 1,286,500 pieces of evidence and logged over 20,300 
    &#8216;hits&#8217;</p>
