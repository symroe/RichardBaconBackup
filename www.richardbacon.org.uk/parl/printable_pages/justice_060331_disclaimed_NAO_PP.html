<p class="bwp4">MP condemns Home Office's 'casual disregard' for taxpayers</p>
<p class="newsbody">South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the 
  Commons public accounts committee, has said the failure of the Home 
  Office to produce a proper set of accounts shows a &#8220;casual disregard for 
  the use of taxpayers&#8217; money&#8221; and called for Sir John Gieve, now Deputy 
  Governor of the Bank of England, to be called back to explain the mess 
  to Parliament.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as Sir John Bourn, Comptroller and 
  Auditor General and head of the National Audit Office (NAO), presented his 
  General Report to Parliament today (Friday, 31 March 2006), in which Sir John 
  states that he was required to issue a &#8216;disclaimer of opinion&#8217; on the Home 
  Office accounts.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The rare step of issuing a disclaimer of opinion is taken by 
  the Comptroller and Auditor General when there are such fundamental problems 
  with the accounts, due to the lack of audit evidence, that he is unable to reach 
  an opinion on the truth and fairness of the accounts.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said: &nbsp;&#8220;The Home Office is currently driving 
  forward plans for ID cards and the merger of local police forces.&nbsp; Both these 
  schemes, no matter how ill-conceived, are going to cost huge amounts of money.&nbsp; 
  How can taxpayers possibly have any confidence in the proper use of their money 
  if the Home Office cannot even reconcile its cash? It is simply unacceptable 
  that we have been left in the dark over how the Home Office is using our money&#8221;.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said responsibility for the situation rested 
  with Sir John Gieve, former permanent secretary at the Home Office but now 
  Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, and that he should be called back to 
  explain himself to Parliament. </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The Accounting Officer, Sir John Gieve, failed in his 
  duty to Parliament and to taxpayers and he should be called back to explain the 
  mess&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon also praised the work of the National Audit 
  Office, adding:&nbsp; &#8220;I would like to thank Sir John Bourn and his team for their 
  tireless work in monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of how government 
  departments use taxpayers&#8217; money.&nbsp; They do an excellent job on behalf of all 
  taxpayers&#8221;.</b></p>
