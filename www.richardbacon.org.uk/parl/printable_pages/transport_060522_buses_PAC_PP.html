bus use
</div>


	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
	Bacon has written to transport bosses at county hall and the Managing 
	Director of Norfolk&#8217;s largest commercial bus operator regarding a new report 
	which finds that the Department for Transport is almost entirely reliant on 
	local authorities to influence bus use and has little idea of how the bus 
	service market is operating outside London.<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">The Commons public accounts committee published its report on the delivery of bus services in England today (Tuesday 23 May, 2006). The report finds that a 32 per cent increase in bus use in London between 2000 and 2005 has not been matched anywhere else in England, with the Eastern region showing the third largest decline in bus passengers over the same period. The Department of Transport and local authorities have limited influence over commercial operators, who provide 80 per cent of services outside London

<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the committee, said today:

	<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;In Norfolk&#8217;s rural communities, buses are becoming an increasingly rare sight and the decline in their use and looks set to continue. The Department for Transport has failed to keep track of the bus market outside London and has no idea whether the larger commercial operators have too much sway over local services and the fares that are charged&#8221;. 

	</b>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;I have sent copies of this report to the Managing Director of First Bus &#8211; Norfolk&#8217;s largest commercial operator &#8211; and the Director of Planning and Transportation at Norfolk County Council, as this report raises important questions as to whether Norfolk is getting the best possible deal from its bus services and I am most interested in their comments&#8221;.
