<p class="bwp4">&#8216;Wild West&#8217; energy market in need of a better sheriff, says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">SOUTH 
  NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has likened the UK&#8217;s energy market to a &#8216;Wild West&#8217; town in need of a better sheriff, as a new report finds that Ofgem should be stamping out mis-selling, 
  investigating why customers with pre-payment electricity meters are 
  paying too much and looking at why some electricity consumers switched 
  suppliers for a better deal but ended up paying more. </b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"><b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The UK&#8217;s energy market looks increasingly like a &#8216;wild west&#8217; town in 
  need of a better sheriff.&nbsp; Energy firms are very quick on the draw 
  in raising prices or penalising customers on pre-payment meters but 
  Ofgem seems agonizingly slow in taking effective action to protect 
  consumers&#8221;.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Ofgem is relying on consumers&#8217; ability 
  to switch suppliers in order to generate competition and to 
  force prices down, but if people are inadvertently switching to 
  more expensive deals then something is going wrong and Ofgem&#8217;s 
  approach is not working&#8221;.&#8220;There are 5.4 million people in fuel 
  poverty and winter is almost here.&nbsp; Ofgem needs to do much 
  better, especially in protecting vulnerable consumers, or it 
  should hand in its badge&#8221;. </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public 
  accounts committee published its report on the removal of price 
  controls from the energy, telecommunications and postal service 
  sectors.&nbsp; The report finds 
  that regulators rely on consumers&#8217; ability to switch suppliers 
  in order to put pressure on suppliers to provide lower prices 
  and better service, but a survey of electricity consumers who 
  had switched found that about a quarter had inadvertently moved 
  to a more expensive supplier.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody">Ofgem believes that prepayment meter 
  customers are paying more for their energy than is justified by 
  the additional costs of the meter.&nbsp; The report also finds mis-selling 
  by energy companies continues to occur, despite a recommendation 
  by the Commons public accounts committee in 2000 that Ofgem 
  should take action.</p>
<p class="newsbody">According to price comparison website 
  uSwitch.com, 5.4 million homes are now spending 10 per cent 
  or more of their disposable income on energy, which is the 
  definition of fuel poverty.&nbsp; Research by uSwitch.com also found 
  that almost a third of pensioner households are now in fuel 
  poverty, as are 20 per cent of families with one income and 17 
  per cent of single person working households.</p>
