<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon has called on the Department for Work and Pensions to make sure it gets results for the money it spends on helping disabled people look for work.
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report 
  on the support the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) gives to 
  disabled people looking for work. The DWP spent &pound;320 million in 2004-05 
  funding programmes to help disabled people find and keep a job.</p>
<p class="newsbody"> The report finds the DWP has little understanding of the return it gets on this expenditure on work programmes and that many of the schemes it funds overlap, only reaching a minority of those who could benefit. </p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;Most disabled people want to work 
  and &pound;320 million of taxpayers&#8217; money has been spent in helping disabled 
  people to find and keep a job. This money could have achieved so much 
  but unfortunately, the DWP has little idea whether the money has been 
  spent effectively&#8221;.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Disabled people deserve better than this. I am 
  pleased to hear the DWP is reviewing the programmes it offers and I urge 
  ministers to make sure this money is truly effective in helping disabled 
  people find and keep a job&#8221;.</p>
