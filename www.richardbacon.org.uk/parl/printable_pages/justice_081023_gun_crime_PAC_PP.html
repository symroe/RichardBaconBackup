<h3><span class="bigword4">Home Office &#8216;could do 
better&#8217; on fighting violent crime, says MP </span></h3>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, has said that the Home Office &#8216;could do better&#8217; in fighting violent crime.
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said: 
    &#8220;People are 
    increasingly worried about violent crime and the growing use of 
    knives and firearms.&nbsp; The Home Office says it shares their 
    concerns, but it needs to improve its effectiveness in fighting 
    violent crime.</b>
  <p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;Home Office 
    funding to stop violent crime often arrives too late to tackle 
    the causes of violence and instead gets spent on dealing with 
    its aftermath. </b> </p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;The Home Office should be sharing the most 
    effective means of tackling violent crime with local Crime and 
    Disorder Reduction Partnerships, yet only half of the 
    Partnerships thought the Home Office was effective at this, 
    partially because the Home Office has no reliable data on 
    whether early deterrents to violent behaviour are working.&nbsp; 
    Frankly, the Home Office could do better. </b> </p>
  <p class="newsbody"> <b> &#8220;Knives, guns 
    and gang-related violence are becoming increasingly common on 
    our streets.&nbsp; If the Home Office is serious about fighting 
    violent crime then it needs to support local Partnerships more 
    effectively than at present&#8221;</b>.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
    Commons public accounts committee published its report into 
    reducing the risk of violent crime.&nbsp; The number of recorded crimes involving a firearm 
    doubled between 1998&#8211;99 and 2005&#8211;06, as did the number of 15&#8211;17 
    year olds convicted of carrying a knife in public.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbody"> However, the 
    report finds that the Home Office&#8217;s attempts to tackle serious 
    violent crime and gang-related violence have been undermined by 
    poor distribution of funding and by the Department&#8217;s mixed 
    performance in spreading good practice.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="newsbody"> Local Crime and Disorder Reduction 
    Partnerships usually receive funding for tackling violence late 
    in the financial year, and money is often one-off and 
    short-term. This approach to funding results to expenditure 
    being targeted at the consequences of violence, and not its 
    causes. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="newsbody"> An important role for the Home 
    Office is to spread good practice about tackling violent crime, 
    but only half of Partnerships thought the Home Office was 
    effective at this. In part, this was because the Department had 
    not collected reliable data on the use and effectiveness of 
    interventions such as Safer School Partnerships, despite both 
    police and schools seeing these arrangements as an effective 
    early deterrent to violent behaviour.
