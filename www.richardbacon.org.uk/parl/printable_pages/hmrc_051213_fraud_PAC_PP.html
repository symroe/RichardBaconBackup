<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Tax fraud would pay for 100 years' policing, says MP </p>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has calculated that the amount of money the UK 
  lost to fraud on VAT and on fuel duty in 2003-04 is enough to pay 
  Norfolk&#8217;s policing bill for the next one hundred years.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was 
  speaking as the committee&#8217;s report into the performance of HM Customs 
  and Excise in 2003-04 was published.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The report finds that losses through VAT fraud, together with fraud on 
  hydrocarbon oils excise duty, mainly petrol and diesel, cost the public 
  &pound;13 billion for the year in question &#8211; over 100 times the budget for 
  Norfolk police of &pound;127 million for 2005-06.&nbsp; Alternatively, the 
  losses could meet Norfolk&#8217;s education budget of &pound;446 million for almost 
  30 years.
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;When you look at what these losses could 
  actually pay for, you get some idea of the staggering amounts of money 
  that are simply disappearing every year.&nbsp; To make matters worse, 
  Customs and Excise are still not dealing with this problem effectively&#8221;.&nbsp; </b> </p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The quality of intelligence on fraud is patchy 
    and few fraudsters have been brought to justice.&nbsp; Even those few 
    who are caught have received unacceptably low sentences, averaging just 
    15 months in prison.&nbsp; HM Revenue and Customs needs to do a much 
    better job of finding and punishing fraudsters if these enormous losses 
    are to be stopped&#8221;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</b></p>
