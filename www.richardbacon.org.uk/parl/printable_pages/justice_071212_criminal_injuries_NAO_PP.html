<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">MP slams &lsquo;absurd&rsquo; performance of Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority</p>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard 
  Bacon has said that the management of the Criminal&nbsp; Injuries 
  Compensation Authority does not appear to be up to the job, as a new 
  report finds the authority's performance has declined over the last 
  seven years.</p>
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;It is absurd but true that the average time to 
  resolve a case has risen from 364 days to 515 days at a time when 
  applications are down by 23 per cent.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;These figures tell a story of indifference 
  bordering on sloth. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority is 
  failing the victims of crime.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The Authority is also failing taxpayers, who keep paying more even 
  though it keeps achieving less. Victims of crime have to cope with 
  more than enough trauma without also facing incompetence and red 
  tape from those who are supposed to be helping them. </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;Ministers need to sort out the management of the authority, which 
  does not appear to be up to the job&#8221;.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office published its 
  report into the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), the 
  non-departmental public body which pays statutory financial 
  compensation to victims of violent crime. &nbsp;CICA received 61,000 
  applications for compensation in 2006-07 and paid out &pound;192 million 
  to victims. </p>
<p class="newsbody">However, the report finds CICA&#8217;s performance has declined since the 
  National Audit Office last reported on it in 2000.&nbsp; The average time 
  to resolve a case has increased by over 40 per cent, from 364 days 
  in 1998-99 to 515 days in 2006-07, even though the number of 
  applications CICA receives each year fell by 23 per cent over the 
  same period.&nbsp; Additionally, the number of cases CICA completed in a 
  year fell from 74,900 in 1998-99 to 59,100 in 2006-07. &nbsp;Over the 
  same period, CICA&#8217;s administration costs increased by &pound;4.2 million.</p>
