</div>

	
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">
		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has expressed concern that trains on the West Coast Main Line are already overcrowded, despite an ambitious upgrade programme whose costs have rocketed to nearly £9 billion, £6 billion more than the original estimate. 
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">
		<b>&#8220;The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) 
				managed to save the West Coast Main Line upgrade from total 
				collapse, but it was too late to stop the project&#8217;s costs from 
				exploding to almost £9 billion, £6 billion over the original 
				estimate&#8221;.&nbsp; </b> 
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Unfortunately, the upgrade seems to 
				have provided only a temporary solution, as the line is already 
				overcrowded at peak times.&nbsp; The Department for Transport and 
				Network Rail must look at every reasonable option to increase 
				capacity and minimise disruption&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Simply telling commuters who pay £5,000 
				a year for season tickets to accept that they may not get a seat 
				is not good enough&#8221;.&nbsp;</b></p>
				<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">
				Mr Bacon was speaking as 
				the Commons public accounts committee published its report on 
				the West Coast Main Line.&nbsp; Former 
				rail infrastructure owners <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">
				Railtrack agreed to upgrade the busy but aging West Coast Main 
				Line in 1998.&nbsp; However, t</span>he report finds that Railtrack&#8217;s<span 
    style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"> original aim to upgrade the line in two 
				phases, in 2002 and 2005, using untried signalling technology, 
				proved overly ambitious and the programme quickly ran into 
				difficulty. &nbsp;Railtrack&#8217;s estimates of cost increased rapidly, 
				contributing to a financial crisis for Railtrack which went into 
				administration in October 2001. </span></span></p>
				<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">In 
				early 2002, the Strategic Rail Authority intervened to take the 
				programme forward, with Network Rail taking over from Railtrack 
				in October 2002.&nbsp; Modernisation of the line is likely to cost 
				around £8.6 billion, £6 billion more than forecast in 1998. 
				Network Rail has improved control over costs but expects to 
				spend £300 million more than the £3 billion allocated by the 
				Rail Regulator for the period 2004-08. The line is still prone 
				to overcrowding on peak services and is likely to require 
				further investment to accommodate predicted future growth in 
				passenger numbers. </span><b><br>
