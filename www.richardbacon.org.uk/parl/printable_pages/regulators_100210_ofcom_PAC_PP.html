<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">Ofcom budgeting 'back to front', says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody">COMMENTING ON the Commons public  accounts committee&rsquo;s report on Ofcom and the effectiveness of converged  regulation, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said:</p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;On the face of it,  Ofcom is discharging its duties adequately.&nbsp;  The communications market functions quite well and competition is  driving down prices for consumers.&nbsp;  However, there are deeper concerns surrounding the way Ofcom provides  value for money.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Five organisations  were merged to create Ofcom, but the expected benefits of the merger were not  made clear and it is uncertain exactly how much money was saved.&nbsp; Ofcom has also been double-counting some  savings across a number of years and it is hard to judge Ofcom&rsquo;s performance  because, although Ofcom sets out what it wants to achieve for consumers, it  doesn&rsquo;t say how success will be measured.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Ofcom&rsquo;s budgeting  process is back-to-front.&nbsp; Whilst most  organisations set their budget based on their future plans, Ofcom operates  under a funding cap and sets its future plans based on the level of the  cap.&nbsp; This may ensure Ofcom stays within  its funding limits but it also removes any incentive Ofcom has to work towards  better value for money.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbold"><strong>&ldquo;Ofcom must address these issues, particularly the  barriers that prevent Ofcom from being held to account and ensuring value for  money&rdquo;.</strong></p>
