<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">
		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, today commented on the report in The Observer newspaper of a confidential document assessing the troubled computer firm iSOFT&#8217;s work for the National Health Service&#8217;s National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT):
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">
<b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;This document is devastating. It reveals that an absolutely central part of the £15 billion National Programme for IT in the NHS is in a hopeless mess.&#8221; 
<br>
<br>
		&#8220;Even worse, the document was produced by the very firms the Government is relying on to introduce the National Programme in three out of five regions across the country. It seems highly unlikely that the Lorenzo patient record system that iSOFT is supposed to be developing can ever be made to work on a scale and at a cost - and in a timeframe - which will meet the Government's targets&#8221;. 
</b>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;It is now more clear than ever that the National 
		Programme for IT in the NHS is in meltdown. This Programme was conceived 
		in an ill-considered rush and announced by the Prime Minister with 
		optimistic hype. It has already cost taxpayers £1,500 million yet if it 
		fails the Programme will waste many times more than this, as well as the 
		effort, time and goodwill of thousands of clinical professionals and 
		health service managers across the country&#8221;. <br>
		<br>
		&#8220;The NHS is just too big and too complex for its IT programme to be run 
		by some Stalinist monolith dreamed up on a sofa in No 10. Action is 
		needed at once to set up an IT programme that can actually meet the 
		needs of the NHS and its patients&#8221;.</b><br>
		<br>
		The assessment was undertaken by two &#8220;Local Service Providers&#8221; under the 
		Programme, CSC and Accenture, who have contracted with iSOFT to provide 
		a key patient care record system called Lorenzo. This system would be 
		used by around 600,000 NHS clinicians and managers and affect perhaps 30 
		million patients. CSC and Accenture are responsible for introducing the 
		NPfIT in three out of five regions (North West/West Midlands, North 
		East, and Eastern). The document provides devastating evidence of major 
		problems and delays with Lorenzo, and suggests that this central part of 
		the NPfIT may never be properly completed. <br>
		<br>
		The document divides Lorenzo issues into five broad categories, with 
		sub-topics under each. It then gives a red, green or amber 
		classification to each sub-topic, where red is defined raising an issue 
		needing immediate work, amber is an issue raising a potential risk, and 
		green is a topic raising no problem or risk. Of the 39 sub-topics, 13 
		are classified red, 21 are classified amber and only 5 are classified 
		green.<br>
		<br>
		One key issue classified red is clinical safety. iSOFT only appointed Dr 
		Param Sandhu as clinical director for UK and Ireland in December 2005, 
		and the document states that &#8220;Dr Sandhu could not articulate the 
		timeframes for establishing a clinical safety team given the current 
		financial climate within iSOFT&#8221;. (NB At the beginning of February 2006, 
		the ISOFT share price was £3.50, now it is around 50p.) <br>
		<br>
		Another key issue is scalability &#8211; i.e. whether the system work when 
		used by a very large number of people at once (perhaps 100,000). The 
		document states: &#8220;the strict adherence to standard development 
		procedures and bottom-up approach to component development and 
		requirement gathering has resulted in a product that does not meet LSP 
		performance requirements and evidence was not provided that the Lorenzo 
		product in its current form could scale to the instance sizes required.&#8221; </p>
