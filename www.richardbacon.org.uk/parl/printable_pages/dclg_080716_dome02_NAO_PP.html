<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Lessons from &lsquo;zero to hero&rsquo; Dome </p>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH 
  NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has said that the government must learn from 
  the success of The 0<sub>2 </sub>&nbsp;- formerly the much-derided 
  Millennium Dome. </p>
<p class="newsbold"> &#8220;The O<sub>2</sub> is a world-beating entertainment venue yet it 
  was created out of a national joke.</p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;When the government tried to entice the public 
  into the Millennium Dome, they stayed away.&nbsp; Once the Dome was handed 
  over to people who knew what they were doing, it became the world&#8217;s top 
  music venue.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbold">&#8220;The Dome&#8217;s &#8216;zero to hero&#8217; transformation proves 
  that the government does not have the first clue about entertaining the 
  public.&nbsp; This offers a good lesson for the future - the government 
  should stay out of things it doesn&#8217;t understand&#8221;.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office 
  (NAO) published its report into the regeneration of the Greenwich 
  Peninsula.&nbsp; The report finds that the Millennium Dome, now known as The 
  O<sub>2</sub>, has become a highly successful entertainment venue. 
  &nbsp;Within six months of its opening, The O<sub>2</sub> sold over 1.2 
  million tickets and arranged 135 events, 90 per cent of its annual 
  target.&nbsp; The O<sub>2 </sub>was reported to be the most popular music 
  venue in the world for 2007.</p>
<p class="newsbody">The Millennium Dome opened on 1 January 2000, but 
  the attraction failed to attract the 12 million paying visitors 
  predicted and by September 2000, it had slashed its forecast to 4.5 
  million paying visitors.&nbsp; </p>
