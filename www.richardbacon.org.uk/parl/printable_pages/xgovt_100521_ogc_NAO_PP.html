<p class="newsbody">COMMENTING ON the publication of the 
  joint report by the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission 
  which reviews collaborative procurement across the public sector, 
  South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said: </span></font></p>
<p class="newsbold"><b>&#8220;It should be 
  obvious that when the public sector buys in bulk it has the 
  potential to make real savings without hitting frontline services.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;However, the public sector is still not working properly to drive 
down the costs of bog-standard office items.&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
<p class="newsbold"><b>&#8220;For example, some 
  government departments are paying more than twice as much for paper 
  as others, while the difference between the cheapest and the most 
  expensive toner cartridge purchased by the public sector is a 
whopping 745 per cent.&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
<p class="newsbold"><b>&#8220;Wasteful public 
  sector procurement is, sadly, nothing new.&nbsp; In 2006, it was 
  discovered that civil servants were turning up their noses at 
  cheaper, centrally purchased items and that even the most frugal 
  bureaucrats were buying Post-It notes at more than double the price 
on the high street.&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
<p class="newsbold"><b>&#8220;The Office of 
  Government Commerce (OGC) was supposed to be bringing this sort of 
  crazy paper chase to an end, but so far its efforts appear to have 
  had limited success.&nbsp; The OGC needs to raise its game dramatically.&nbsp; 
  We simply cannot go on paying for personalised pencils or overpriced 
  envelopes for tiny fiefdoms across the public sector&#8221;.</span></font></b>
