says report</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Following the </span>publication of the National Audit Office report on managing financial resources to deliver better public services, which states that the Ministry of Defence does not currently have a 
  qualified finance director, Conservative MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said:</p> 
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>&#8220;The Ministry of Defence&#8217;s finance director is overseeing 
  seven per cent of government expenditure without a financial qualification&#8221;.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>&#8220;It should be obvious that finance directors should have a financial 
    qualification. The Treasury should enforce this&#8221;. </b></p>

  <p class="liltext" style="text-autospace: none"><i> Exchange 
    between Mr Richard Bacon MP, Mr Trevor Woolley (Finance Director, 
    Ministry of Defence), Sir John Bourn KCB (then Comptroller and 
    Auditor General, National Audit Office), Ms Paula Diggle (Treasury 
    Officer of Accounts) and Mr Bill Jeffrey CB (Permanent Secretary, 
    Ministry of Defence) during the Commons public accounts committee 
    hearing on the privatisation of QinetiQ, 3 December 2007:</i></p>

    <p class="liltext"> Q193 Mr Bacon: &#8230; Mr Woolley, are you a chartered accountant?</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Mr Woolley: I am not.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q194 Mr Bacon: Are you a qualified financial person of any kind? 
      Do you have any financial qualifications?</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Mr Woolley: I do not have financial qualifications.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q195 Mr Bacon: What is your job?</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Mr Woolley: I am the Finance Director of the Ministry of Defence.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q196 Mr Bacon: Yes, that is what I thought. It is what it says 
      here. Sir John, we have discussed this before when finance directors 
      were called principal finance officers, and I think when I first 
      asked the question some years ago only 23% of principal finance 
      officers had a financial qualification. I think it has gone up 
      significantly in the last little while. The number that sticks in my 
      mind is 60%. Do you have any idea what the current level is?</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Sir John Bourn: I think by now it is more than 60, but there are, 
      of course, exceptions, as in the case of Mr Woolley.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q197 Mr Bacon: Yes, it would appear the MoD is an exception.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Ms Diggle: I believe it is well over 90%.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q198 Mr Bacon: It is well over 90%, so Mr Woolley is in a very 
      small category?</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Ms Diggle: He is.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q199 Mr Bacon: And yet he is responsible for a &pound;32 billion 
      budget.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Ms Diggle: He is.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q200 Mr Bacon: Is this not a bit of an omission on the part of 
      the Treasury in its zeal to encourage qualifications by -----</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Ms Diggle: We are trying to make it a blanket requirement. We 
      have not quite got there yet.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q201 Mr Bacon: Does trying to make it a blanket qualification 
      include Mr Woolley?</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Ms Diggle: We are trying to get to 100%.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Mr Jeffrey: If I may make a comment, Mr Bacon, Mr Woolley in my 
      view does a very good job as Finance Director.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Q202 Mr Bacon: I was not asking about the quality of the job he 
      does.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Mr Jeffrey: But it is my intention that his successor should be 
      financially qualified, as the policy requires.</p>
    <p class="liltext"> Mr Bacon: Good; I am glad to hear it.</p>
