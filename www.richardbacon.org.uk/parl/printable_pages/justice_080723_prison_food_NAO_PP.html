<h3>&ldquo;Let prisons buy local food&rdquo; says MP</h3>
  <br>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard 
    Bacon has said that prisons should not be stopped from buying locally 
    sourced food, as a new report finds that HM Prisons' Central Procurement 
    Unit is investigating the cost of food purchased locally versus food 
    purchased under a central contract.
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>&#8220;The improvements in Prison Service procurement are welcome, but it 
    will be a great pity if the Prison Service stops individual prisons from 
    buying locally sourced food.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>&#8220;The Prison Service&#8217;s National Procurement Unit was told that 
    locally-sourced food offered better value for money than central 
    contracts.&nbsp; The Unit investigated, but found that food bought under a 
    central contract was actually the cheapest option.&nbsp; Of course the 
    central contract worked out cheaper, but the Unit has missed the point. </b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>&#8220;Locally sourced food is usually fresher, tastier and healthier than 
    the alternatives.&nbsp; Sourcing local food also keeps transportation costs 
    down and supports the local community.&nbsp; The Prison Service needs to 
    remember this when it extends the study across the Prison estate. </b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> <b>&#8220;Prisons should be allowed to source food locally&#8221;.</b>
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office published its report 
    into the procurement of goods and services by HM Prison Service.&nbsp; The 
    report finds that the Prison Service has made major progress in 
    achieving better value for money.&nbsp; 
    
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> In 2008 the Prison Service&#8217;s National Procurement Unit continued to 
    receive feedback stating that local suppliers of food offered greater 
    value for money than central contracts.&nbsp; The Unit conducted a detailed 
    product-by-product price comparison of foodstuffs purchased outside the 
    national contract by HMP Leeds.&nbsp; The Unit found that costs under the 
    national contract were 9.2 per cent cheaper.&nbsp; 
    
  <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt"> The Prison Service plans to extend this study across the rest of the 
    prison estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
