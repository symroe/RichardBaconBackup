		<p class="newsbody">RICHARD BACON MP has continued his campaign to introduce a bill calling for compulsory country of origin 
  labelling for meat and meat products. Mr Bacon&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s  Bill, which seeks to amend the Food Labelling Regulations 1996, received its second reading in the House of Commons.</p>
		<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon told the House: &ldquo;My Bill seeks to do one thing: I just want consumers to know where meat comes from. I want them to <em>know</em>, not to think or to guess or to hope. </p>
		<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;If producers say on the label that meat is British, it should actually be British.</p>
		<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;There are  not many people out there who disagree with what I am saying about the need to  address the problem. An ICM poll for the Honest Food campaign showed that 87%  of consumers in the survey believe that the Government should ensure that the  country of origin is clearly shown on food products. </p>
		<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;The survey also showed  that 89% believe that when a product such as sausages or bacon is labelled as &ldquo;British&rdquo;  or &ldquo;produced in the UK&rdquo;, it should mean that the sausages or bacon  are from an animal reared in Britain&rdquo;. </p>
		<p class="newsbody">This is  Mr Bacon&rsquo;s fourth attempt to bring in a Bill to amend the Food Labelling Regulations  1996 and his first opportunity to get a Second  Reading debate. </p>
		<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon brought his first Bill before the House of Commons in March 2004 and continued his campaign with Bills in October 2008 and March 2009. </p>
