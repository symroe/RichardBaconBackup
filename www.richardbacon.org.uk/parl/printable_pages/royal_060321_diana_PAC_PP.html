<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">Diana memorial a fitting tribute, 
says MP<br>
</p>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon, who used to work in Hyde Park as a gardener, has praised the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain as a fitting tribute to the late princess, but has criticised the project management failures that dogged the memorial after it opened in 2004.  
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published its report on the Royal Parks and the Fountain.  
The report finds the project was poorly managed and costs ran 
  out of control, leaving the Royal Parks with an annual maintenance bill 
  of &pound;250,000. 
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The 
    Memorial Fountain is a fitting monument and tribute to the Princess.&nbsp; 
    The area of the fountain is beautiful and peaceful and I would recommend 
    people to see it for themselves, as many thousands are now doing&#8221;.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="newsbold">&#8220;It is deeply 
    regrettable that easily avoidable mistakes and poor project management 
    turned this excellent memorial into a punch line.&nbsp; For instance, I can 
    scarcely believe nobody realised that water spraying onto turf and soil 
    in what was already a marshy area would result in a quagmire&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;I am glad the 
    problems have now been sorted out.&nbsp; The fountain is now one of the best 
    places to go in any park in London&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>Mr Bacon added: &#8220;My 
    first job on leaving university was as an assistant gardener for the 
    Royal Parks, so I know just how hard the staff are working to provide 
    first class green spaces for all to enjoy.&nbsp; I have great admiration for 
    their skills and I congratulate them on what they doing&#8221;.</b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;The Royal Parks do 
    need to be more creative in generating income, though, for example 
    through the sale of branded merchandise which could prove very 
    popular&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">The Royal Parks 
    currently face a &pound;65 million backlog of maintenance work, which must be 
    met from an annual income of around &pound;7 million.&nbsp; The report finds there 
    is untapped potential for the Royal Parks to increase income from its 
    assets, although it has little information about the profitability of 
    some income generating activities.</p>
