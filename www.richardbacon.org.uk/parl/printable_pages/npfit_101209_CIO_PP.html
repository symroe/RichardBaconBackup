<blockquote id="letter">Ms  Christine Connelly<br>
            Chief  Information Officer for Health<br>
            Department  of Health<br>
            Richmond  House<br>
            London  SW1A 2NS<br>

            23  March 2010<br>
            <br>
            Dear  Ms Connelly<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Negotiation of memorandum of understanding with CSC</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Further to our discussion yesterday at the Public Accounts  Committee, I am writing to you to seek greater clarification on the points you  made about the Memorandum of Understanding which the NHS is currently  negotiating with CSC.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is my understanding that a number of acute hospital Trusts that  have indicated that they might be prepared to take iSoft&rsquo;s Lorenzo system will  not be able to do so for operational reasons.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Indeed, I understand that  many Trusts have actually made alternative arrangements to take systems from  other suppliers on the basis that there is very little evidence that Lorenzo  will offer the functionality which they require.
<br>
            <br>
            There is therefore a large disconnect between the optimistic  assessment of the Department of Health as to how many Trusts will actually want  Lorenzo and the reality.
            <br>
            <br>
            My question to you is: If you sign the Memorandum of Understanding  with CSC and then it turns out that &ndash; as a result of the recent reduction in  scope for Lorenzo and the well-documented difficulties in deploying it smoothly  at larger Trusts &ndash; hospital trusts refuse to take Lorenzo because it is not  adequate for their needs, what is the financial exposure of the NHS and the  Secretary of State?<br>
            <br>
            Yours sincerely<br>
            <strong>Richard  Bacon</strong><br>
            <em>MP  for South Norfolk</em><br>
            <em>Member  of the Public Accounts Committee</em>
