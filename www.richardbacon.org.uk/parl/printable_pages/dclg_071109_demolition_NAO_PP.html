<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has called on the government to think carefully before ripping apart established communities in areas targeted by a &pound;2.2 billion scheme to renew neighbourhoods in decline, as a new report finds that so far it is unclear whether the programme is working adequately and the scheme risks causing residents stress and uncertainty.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office published its report on housing market renewal. The &pound;2.2 billion Housing Market Renewal programme was launched in 2002 to tackle the problems of neighbourhoods in decline. The report finds that there is no guarantee this scheme will be successful and that where major demolition work is proposed there is a high risk the programme could cause stress, uncertainty and lead to the loss of tightly-knit communities. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;It is unclear whether this scheme is having the desired effect in making deprived urban areas attractive to families and businesses.  In some places it actually risks making life harder for many residents who face having their local community torn down around them&#8221;. </b>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The aims of the programme are laudable, but the government should not rip apart tightly-knit neighbourhoods to achieve them.  You cannot solve the problems of urban deprivation with the wrecking ball alone&#8221;. </b>
