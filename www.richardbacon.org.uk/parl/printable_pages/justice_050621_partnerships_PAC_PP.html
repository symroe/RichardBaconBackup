to trade techniques </p>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has called on the Home Office to do more to help local crime reduction bodies share information, as a report into Home Office-backed initiatives to cut crime was published by the influential Commons public accounts Committee. </span></b></span></p>
<p class="newsbold"><span class="newsbody" style="margin-right:8pt; text-align:justify"><b>Mr Bacon, 
  who is a member of the committee, said: 
  &ldquo;Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships are intended to help local people solve local problems, but there is a lack of communication between Partnerships and the Home Office.</b></span></p>
<p class="newsbold">&ldquo;For example, the report shows that one Partnership's preventative approach yielded a 50 per 
  cent cut in burglaries. The techniques behind this sort of success must be 
  shared&rdquo;. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">The report found that, by establishing the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, the Home Office had provided local communities with the means of finding innovative solutions to local problems, but that it could do more in promoting successful schemes to other Partnerships.
<p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon added: &ldquo;The Home Office have launched 14 new crime reduction initiatives for these Partnerships over the last six years, yet a self-assessment framework was only introduced in 2003, some four years after the Partnerships began.  This is far too late, and means some communities have missed out on ideas that have worked elsewhere&rdquo;.</P>
