<p class="bigword4" style="text-autospace: none">The NHS must overhaul dementia care, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0pt"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk </span>MP Richard Bacon has called on the NHS to overhaul the way it diagnoses and treats dementia, as a new report finds that too few people are being diagnosed and that early interventions known to be cost-effective are not made widely available. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify"> Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into improving services and support for dementia sufferers.
  
  The report finds that dementia has not received the priority status from the Department of Health, the NHS or social care that it deserves.
  
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said today: &#8220;Britain&#8217;s population is 
  ageing, meaning that over the next few years an increasing number of 
  families will be affected by dementia.&nbsp; However, health and social 
  services give dementia too low a priority and the NHS is poorly equipped 
  to diagnose and treat dementia cases&#8221;. <span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
				<p class="newsbody"><b><span style="color:black">&#8220;Early diagnosis of 
				  dementia is known to be cost-effective, but only a third of sufferers 
				  ever receive a diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unless the NHS overhauls the way it 
				  tackles dementia, then the country will continue to face patchy and 
				  costly provision in this area&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
				<p class="newsbody">Dementia costs the economy &pound;14.3 billion a year, 
				  including direct costs to the NHS and social care of &pound;3.3 billion a 
				  year.&nbsp; At least 560,000 people in England have dementia and, because of 
				  an ageing population, the number of cases is predicted to rise by over 
				  30 per cent over the next 15 years.&nbsp; </p>
				<p class="newsbody">However, dementia has suffered from poor awareness 
				  and understanding and the report finds there is a widely held perception 
				  that little can be done, leading to a lack of urgency in diagnosing and 
				  treating the condition. &nbsp;Early diagnosis and intervention in cases of 
				  dementia is known to be cost-effective, yet only a third to a half of 
				  people with dementia ever receive a formal diagnosis. </p>
