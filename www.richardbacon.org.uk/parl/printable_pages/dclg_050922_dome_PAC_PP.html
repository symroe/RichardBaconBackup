<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP 
  Richard Bacon has criticised the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for 
  running the competition to buy the Millennium Dome like a 'lucky dip', 
  keeping bidders guessing as to what was really on offer.</p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of 
  the influential Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the 
  committee's report into the regeneration of&nbsp; the Millennium Dome 
  and its associated land was published.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-align:justify">A deal 
  with Meridian Delta has now been concluded to retain the Dome until 
  2018, and redevelop the site.
<p class="newsbold" style="text-autospace: none"> Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;This whole process has been run like a lucky dip, as no 
  potential bidder really knew what was on offer.&nbsp; Information on the deal 
  spilled out in piecemeal fashion and the failed first competition meant 
  there was less interest in the Dome the second time around&rdquo;.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">The report found that 
      the deal initially covered only the 48 acres on which the Dome stood, 
      though 20 additional acres were available if bidders could show it was 
      integral to their plans.&nbsp; Although interest in another 100 acres on the 
      Greenwich peninsula was not discouraged, it was not advertised in order 
      to deter developers who were not really interested in retaining the 
      Dome.</p>
    <p class="newsbold" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon added: &ldquo;It is 
      understandable that the Government are trying to get the best deal to 
      reuse the Dome, but the priority should now be on ensuring this deal 
      delivers what it promises: the regeneration of the Greenwich peninsula.&nbsp; 
      That was the Dome's original objective, after all&rdquo;.</p>
