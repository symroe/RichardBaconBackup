<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">MP says use of consultants is 'flawed and hideously expensive' 
</p><br>
     <p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has described the way that the Government uses consultants as &#8216;flawed and hideously expensive&#8217;, as a  report finds that improvements in the way  consultants are used could save taxpayers more than &pound;500 million a year.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> Mr Bacon, a former consultant who was also Deputy Director of the Management Consultancies Association, which represents over 60 leading consulting firms, said:
     <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <strong><b>&#8220;Too often when hiring consultants 
       the government fails to ask first if its own civil servants 
       could do the job just as well or better, and more cheaply&#8221;. <br>
      <br>
  &#8220;Then 
       where consultants are brought in the project management is often poor. Departments 
       don&#8217;t collect or share information on how consultants perform. 
       And they don&#8217;t plan for transferring the skills to their own 
       staff to build internal capabilities&#8221;.</b></strong>
     <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This is a 
       recipe for repeated failure. In such circumstances it is amazing 
       that projects ever go well. It is no surprise that 40% of public 
       sector clients say they have used consultants when it was not 
       necessary&#8221;.</b>
     <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The whole 
       process is flawed from top to bottom as well as being hideously 
       expensive.&nbsp; It is time the government brought the use of 
       consultants under proper management&#8221;.</b>
     <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons 
       public accounts committee, was speaking as the committee 
       published its report on central government&#8217;s use of consultants.&nbsp; The report finds that the 
       government does not know how much money is spent on consultants 
       or whether the end result justifies the cost.&nbsp; </p>
     <p class="newsbody">Consultants are 
       often hired before departments 
       have checked whether in-house staff could do the job instead, 
       and the report also finds that getting a better 
       grip on the use of consultants could save more than &pound;500 million 
       a year, but only if departments are more commercially astute in 
       their use of consultants and how they procure them.</p>
     <p class="newsbody">The Cabinet Office efficiency unit 
       reported on the use of consultants in 1994 (<span 
    style="FONT-STYLE: italic">&#8220;The Government&#8217;s use of external consultants&#8221;</span> Cabinet Office: An Efficiency Unit scrutiny. August 1994. LONDON 
       : HMSO) and many of its recommendations have been repeated in 
       subsequent reports, including two from the National Audit Office 
       in 2002 and 2006.&nbsp; To date, there has only been limited progress 
       against these recommendations.</p>
     <p class="liltext">Richard Bacon MP was Deputy Director of 
       the Management Consultancies Association, which represents many of the 
       leading UK consulting firms, from May 1994 until October 1996 after which
       he worked as a consultant for 3 years. </p>
