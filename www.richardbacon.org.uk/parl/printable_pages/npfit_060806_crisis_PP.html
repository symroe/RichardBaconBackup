<p class="bwp4" style="text-autospace: none">MP says Blair's NHS computer dream 
		&#8220;won't work&#8221;</p>	

	
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">
		<span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon 
		has called for a halt to the troubled national programme to overhaul NHS computer systems, as the Observer newspaper revealed a confidential document showing that the multi-billion pound project &#8211; the personal initiative of Prime Minister Tony Blair &#8211; is in crisis. 
		<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">The document was apparently written by one of the scheme&#8217;s most senior executives. It suggests that the programme, the world&#8217;s largest civilian IT project, faces such grave problems that hospitals would be better off having never tried to implement it.<p class="newsbody">The story comes at the end of a week when IT systems at 80 hospitals and 
		NHS trusts across the West Midlands and the North West were struggling 
		to recover from the worst computer crash in the history of the health 
		service.
		<p class="newsbody"><b>Richard Bacon MP, the member of the House 
		of Commons Public Accounts Committee to whom the document was first 
		sent, commented:</b> <b>&#8220;The last few months have seen a succession of 
		disasters for the NHS national programme for IT: The North West and West 
		Midlands have seen the worst computer crash in NHS history; the London 
		region has seen its major software supplier sacked and the Health 
		Protection Agency warning of a serious risk to the health of children 
		because IT failures have made a mess of vital vaccination programmes; 
		the Nuffield Orthopaedic Hospital failed all waiting list targets as a 
		direct result of the Connecting for Health deployment; and new systems 
		in North West and West Midlands hospitals have repeatedly lost or 
		mislaid patient records.&nbsp; The list of failures and delays grows ever 
		longer. Two and a half years in, the programme is two years late&#8221;.</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;Now it seems that some of the most senior 
		officials in the NHS know perfectly well that the National Programme 
		will never work properly &#8211; indeed that many hospitals would now be 
		better off if they had never taken part in the scheme in the first 
		place&#8221;.</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The National Programme has already cost well 
		over a billion pounds and the final tally if it continues could rise to 
		over £15 billion. Much of this money will be wasted. Worse still, the 
		health of patients could be put at risk. This scheme was the personal 
		brainchild of the Prime Minister and he must now act at once to bring 
		this failed experiment to a speedy end&#8221;.</b></p>
