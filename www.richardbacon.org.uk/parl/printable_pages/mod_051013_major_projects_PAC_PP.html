<p class="bwp4">MoD kit blunders letting down our troops, says MP</p>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has hit out at Ministry of 
  Defence officials for ignoring their own rules when buying military equipment, 
  and dodging responsibility for costly blunders. </p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the 
  Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the committee's report on the 
  MoD's biggest equipment projects was published.&nbsp; The report says that cost overruns of some &pound;5 billion since 2003 are 
  putting pressure on an already strained defence budget. </p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said: "It is disgraceful that the MoD cannot even 
  manage to follow its own rules.&nbsp; This has meant that, after six years, 'Smart' 
  Acquisition has not achieved very much, making it look more like dumb 
  acquisition&quot;.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody">The report finds that equipment delays are worse than at 
  any time in the last decade, and the MoD could not say when it expected to see 
  any consistent improvement in the situation.&nbsp; The report also found that still 
  not enough work is undertaken early in a project to prevent a bad investment 
  decision.</p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon added: "It seems no one at the MoD is ever to 
  blame for this sorry mess.&nbsp; It is our servicemen and women who lose out, yet the 
  MoD seems to feel little embarrassment in continually letting them down.&nbsp; This 
  must stop&quot;.</strong></p>
