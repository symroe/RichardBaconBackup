disabled workers </p>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon 
		          has called on the government to do more to improve the quality of assistance it gives to disabled people looking for work.  
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as the National Audit Office published its report 
      on the support the Department of Work and Pensions gives to disabled 
      people who are either seeking work or already in employment. </p>
    <p class="newsbold"> Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;Disabled people deserve the same level of access to employment as everyone else, but this is not yet possible because the Department doesn't know exactly what initiatives are available to help people into work. That situation cannot be acceptable.</p>
    <p class="newsbody">The report finds that there is limited support available to help disabled people stay in work where their conditions could make it difficult for them to do so.  It suggests that greater support for those in work could ease demand on existing programmes and keep down government spending on disability benefits.</p>
    <p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon added: 
      &ldquo;Most disabled people want to work.  It gives them the opportunity to participate fully in all aspects of society and make a real contribution.  However, getting a job is not the end of the story, as many will have significant difficulties still to face.  It is important that disabled people in work are supported and know that there is support available&rdquo;.</p>
