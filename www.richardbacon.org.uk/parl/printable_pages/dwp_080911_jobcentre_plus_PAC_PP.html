<h3><span class="bwp4">Experience vital to Whitehall success, says MP</span></h3>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"><span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP 
  Richard Bacon has said that experience was the vital factor in 
  Jobcentre Plus&#8217; successful roll out of 800 modernised offices.&nbsp;
<p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon said: 
  &#8220;The &pound;1.9 billion project to replace 1,500 old jobcentres and 
  social security offices with over 800 modernised Jobcentre Plus 
  offices was a resounding success that came in &pound;300 million under 
  budget&#8221;. </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This success is down to strong 
    leadership. The three senior civil servants running this 
    project started their careers at the bottom and worked 
    their way up, accumulating over 100 years&#8217; experience in 
    social security along the way. They knew exactly what 
    problems front-line staff were likely to face because 
    they had been there themselves. As a result, many of the 
    banana skins that traditionally bedevil government 
    programmes were avoided&#8221;. </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;It is all too easy to be cynical 
    about the chances of any major government programme 
    succeeding, but the Jobcentre Plus scheme proves that 
    success is possible and that cost overruns are not 
    inevitable. Experience is the key and the rest of 
    Whitehall must learn from this success&#8221;. </b></p>
  <p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons 
    public accounts committee published its report into the 
    roll-out of the Jobcentre plus office network today. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">Between 2002 and 2008, the 
    Department for Work and Pensions rolled out a &pound;1.9 
    billion programme to replace over 1,500 jobcentres and 
    social security offices across Britain with just over 
    800 modernised Jobcentre Plus offices in one of the UK&#8217;s 
    largest public sector construction programmes of recent 
    years. </p>
  <p class="newsbody">The project was successful in 
    delivering nearly all the planned offices, while making 
    savings against the original budget of &pound;2.2 billion. The 
    report finds that a critical factor in the project&#8217;s 
    success was the consistent senior management team, who 
    between them had over 100 years of front line 
    operational experience in the Agency&#8217;s business. Their 
    willingness to revise the approach to the project as 
    roll out proceeded was also an important factor in 
    success. </p>
