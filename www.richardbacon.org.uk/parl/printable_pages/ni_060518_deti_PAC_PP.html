<h3>MP dismayed as Northern Ireland taxpayers let down again</h3>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon MP has expressed dismay that the people of Northern Ireland have again been let down badly by the province's top officials, as the Commons public accounts committee published a report into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment's governance of its Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU).    
<p class="newsbody">The report describes how the Department's failure to enforce proper ethical standards resulted in one of the worst cases of conflict of interest that the committee has seen to date.
<p class="newsbody">The Deputy Chair of LEDU's board, Mrs Teresa Townsley, together with her 
  husband, were the only partners in an accountancy practice which was 
  appointed, without proper tendering, as managers of EBT, receiving &pound;1.4 
  million in fees between 1997 and 2005. </p>
  <p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon, a member of the committee, said today: &quot;Because Northern 
    Ireland is a relatively small society, the opportunity for conflicts of 
    interest to arise will always be present. Taxpayers should therefore 
    expect the province's senior civil servants to be particularly vigilant 
    in safeguarding proper standards. I am dismayed that the people of 
    Northern Ireland have yet again been let down badly by those who are 
    supposed to ensure the proper use of public money&quot;. </p>
