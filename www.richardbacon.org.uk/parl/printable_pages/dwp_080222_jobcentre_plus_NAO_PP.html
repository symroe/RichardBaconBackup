<h3><span class="bwp4">Make sure Jobcentre staff are trained, says MP</span></h3>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard 
		Bacon has called on the Department of Work and Pensions to plough the 
		savings it has made from the roll-out of the new Jobcentre Plus network 
		into staff training, as a new report finds staff were not ready for 
		their new offices to open.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> <b>Mr Bacon said: &#8220;The roll-out 
  of the Jobcentre Plus office network may have been a success, 
  but some staff were not ready for their new offices to open 
  their doors, and felt overwhelmed.&nbsp; If staff are not trained 
  properly, their posh 
  new offices are an irrelevance&#8221;.&nbsp;</b>
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The Department 
  for Work and Pensions should plough the savings it has made into 
  ensuring that all Jobcentre Plus staff are properly trained&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p class="newsbody">Mr Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, 
  was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its 
  report on the roll-out of the Jobcentre Plus office network.&nbsp; The report finds that staff at 
  some sites told the NAO that they were not adequately trained 
  and felt overwhelmed during the first few months of their 
  offices being open.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="newsbody">A review process was put in place 
  for the project, which included sign-off on staff readiness. 
  However, feedback from those involved in the project suggests 
  that the reliability of this process was questionable and no 
  spot checks were requested to support the sign-off certificates.
