    <p class="newsbody"> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">A member </span>of a powerful 
      committee of MPs has warned the Government and train operating companies to 
      learn from the termination of Connex's rail franchise for Kent and South 
      East England.</b></p>
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">South Norfolk MP Richard 
      Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, was speaking as 
      the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into the South Eastern 
      Passenger Rail Franchis<span class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">e</span>.&nbsp; Connex made an 
      over-ambitious bid for the franchise and ran into financial difficulties 
      early on.&nbsp; Connex failed to reduce its costs as expected and the Strategic 
      Rail Authority subsequently identified a funding gap of up to &pound;0.8 billion 
      for the remainder of the franchise.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">On 27 June 2003, Connex 
      became the first and, to date, only operator to have its franchise 
      terminated early.&nbsp; The Strategic Rail Authority itself was scrapped under 
      the Railways Act 2005 and its franchising role will be transferred to the 
      Department of Transport.</p>
    <p class="newsbold">Mr Bacon said: &ldquo;The Strategic Rail 
      Authority was right to end Connex's franchise.&nbsp; However, the travelling 
      public still faces poor and unreliable service from too many train operating 
      companies.&nbsp; Now that the Department of Transport is taking over the SRA's 
      responsibilities, I hope ministers will be equally vigilant in calling time 
      on train operating companies which are not up to the mark.&nbsp; </b></p>
    <p class="newsbold">&ldquo;I was surprised to 
      learn this summer that One, the train operating company on the route between 
      Norwich and London Liverpool Street, had purchased rolling stock from Virgin 
      Trains without being aware that the air conditioning equipment had not been 
      serviced for two years.&nbsp; Passengers pay a small fortune for their train 
      tickets and they are entitled to expect a high standard of service&rdquo;.</b></p>
