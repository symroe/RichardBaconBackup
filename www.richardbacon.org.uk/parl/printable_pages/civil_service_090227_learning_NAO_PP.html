<h3>Government failing to learn from its mistakes, says MP</h3>
<p class="newsbody"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Commenting on</span> the National Audit Office report on helping government learn, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said:
  
<p class="newsbody"> <b>&#8220;Whether we are running away from sabre-toothed tigers or building aircraft, people usually learn from failure. &nbsp;However, this principle does not always extend across Whitehall. 
  &#8221;</b>
  <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The problem is not that individual civil servants fail to 
    learn from their mistakes, but that many government 
    departments don&#8217;t have an effective way to share their 
    experiences. Other problems include a lack of time for 
    learning and the high turnover within government departments.
    &#8221;&nbsp;</span></font></b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"><b> &#8220;The 
    National Audit Office concludes that investing time and 
    resources in learning lessons from success and failure can 
    lead to improvements in service delivery.&nbsp; This is simple 
    common sense and one wonders why government needs to be told 
    this in the first place.&nbsp; Government must be much more 
    proactive in sharing the reasons behind its successes and 
    failures across Whitehall.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the 
    National Audit Office published its report into helping 
    Government learn.&nbsp; 
    Government traditionally learns lessons after large 
    projects, initiatives or crises.&nbsp; The report finds that, 
    although there is some effective learning within 
    departments, learning is still not as prioritised as much as 
    it should be.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
  <p class="newsbody"> The main barriers to learning 
    within departments are ineffective tools to capture and 
    share learning, keeping insights and information within the 
    team rather than sharing them across the organisation, high 
    turnover within the workforce leading to a loss of 
    knowledge, and a lack of time given to capturing lessons 
    from experience.</span></font></p>
