<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has called for the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to make better contingency plans should any of the private companies responsible for our gas, water and electricity supplies get into financial difficulty.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt">Mr Bacon was speaking as the National Audit Office (NAO) published its report into the Restructuring of British Energy. 
  British Energy requested financial assistance from the DTI after the firm got into financial difficulty in mid-2002.  The DTI agreed to the request in order to maintain electricity supplies and nuclear safety.  As part of this assistance, British Energy&#8217;s liabilities were transferred to the taxpayer, but the DTI had not taken any estimate of those liabilities during restructuring. 
<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of 
the Commons public accounts committee, said: </p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;When British Energy 
		  asked for financial assistance in 2002, the Department found that it had 
		  no choice but to take on British Energy&#8217;s liabilities, even though it 
		  had no idea of their size. In effect, the DTI had to write a blank 
cheque with taxpayers&#8217; money in order to keep the lights on.</b></p>
		<p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;This is the second 
		  NAO report in seven days in which the DTI has failed to make adequate 
		  contingency plans &#8211; the other being MG Rover.&nbsp; This is not acceptable.&nbsp; 
		  I would urge the DTI to look at every private company that provides 
		  basic public utilities and make sure there is a plan in place should 
these firms encounter financial problems&rdquo;. </b></p>
