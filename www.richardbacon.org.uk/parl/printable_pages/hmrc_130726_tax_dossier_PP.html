<h3>MP hands HMRC dossier to Tax Bosses</h3>
<p class="newsbody">SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has provided HM Revenue &amp;  Customs (HMRC) with a dossier compiled from his constituents&rsquo; experiences of  dealing with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s tax authority and called on HMRC to act on  his findings.
<p class="newsbody">Following his recent call for evidence, Mr Bacon received a  range of responses from constituents who had experienced difficulties in  dealing with HMRC.&nbsp; Mr Bacon has collated  and anonymised these responses and submitted them in a report to HMRC Chief  Executive Lin Homer.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>Mr Bacon said today:  &ldquo;The submissions I received in response to my call for evidence centred around  a number of concerns.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;One serious  difficulty is simply getting HMRC to admit that it has made a mistake.&nbsp; Even then, when HMRC is finally persuaded to  admit that it has got things wrong, too often taxpayers still face an uphill struggle  to get HMRC to correct the errors which it has made.</strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;Worse still, some  people are led to understand by HMRC that their particular problem has been  resolved, only to see it recur in each subsequent tax year.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;Some respondents  were annoyed that HMRC takes a very leisurely attitude to refunding taxpayers  the money which it owes them, yet demands near-instantaneous payment when it is  owed money.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;I received one  disturbing account from a self-employed individual who was accused of not  declaring all his income by an HMRC tax inspector, who added to the  individual&rsquo;s accounts the very invoices which his accountant had already  entered, thus doubling his apparent &lsquo;income&rsquo;.&nbsp;  When this gross error was pointed out, the tax inspector then alleged  that the individual had secret accounts containing undeclared income.&nbsp; That inspector has left behind him the belief  that HMRC is a cruel, vindictive and incompetent organisation.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="newsbody"><strong>&ldquo;This report will show HMRC that it has much  to do to improve the way it interacts with the public.&nbsp; I want to thank everyone who took the time to  respond to my call for evidence and I look forward to hearing what Ms Homer has  to say&rdquo;.</strong></p>
