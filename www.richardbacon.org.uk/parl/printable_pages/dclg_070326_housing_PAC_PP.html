<h3><span class="bwp4">Government in the dark over housing, says MP</span></h3>
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">South Norfolk</span> MP Richard Bacon has said the government is in the dark over how the housing assistance it gives public sector workers in the East of England is working, as a new report finds that information on the effect of home ownership assistance on the property market is scare.
<p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> Mr Bacon said: &#8220;It is worrying that the government is in the dark over what impact the assistance scheme is having on local housing markets, or what happens subsequently to properties bought under the scheme&#8221;.  
  
<p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;In areas where demand is already high, the scheme may even be pushing 
  house prices up.&nbsp; This only serves to move property further beyond the 
  reach of many on low incomes.&nbsp; The Department must make sure this does 
  not happen and should start by improving the information it holds on the 
  impact of its low cost home ownership assistance on local housing 
  markets&#8221;.<br>
  </b> <br>
  Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published 
  its report into low cost home ownership assistance.&nbsp; One of the aims of the scheme is to provide financial help 
  to key public sector workers in the Eastern region who would otherwise 
  be unable to buy.&nbsp; </p>
