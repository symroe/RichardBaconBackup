  <h3>MP calls for closure of &#8220;nightmare&#8221;

  <hr size="1" id="line"><br>

<span style="text-transform: uppercase">SOUTH NORFOLK</span> MP Richard Bacon said today that the health service would be better off without Connecting for Health, the Department of Health agency responsible for the national programme for IT in the NHS.</p>
  <p class="newsbody"> Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons public accounts committee published a 
    damning report on the multi-billion pound programme which concludes that &#8220;at the 
    present rate of progress it is unlikely that significant clinical benefits will 
    be delivered by the end of the contract period&#8221;.</p>
  <p class="newsbody">He has called for the agency to be wound up, with 
    most of its budget handed over to local hospital bosses and any 
    remaining functions handled by the Department of Health. </p>
            <p class="newsbody"><b>Mr Bacon, a member of the 
              committee, said: &#8220;Connecting for Health has produced exceptional anger and 
              frustration among doctors, nurses, and hospital managers. It is a nightmare 
              organisation and I think the NHS would be better off without it&#8221;.&nbsp; </b></p>
	        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The bulk of the programme 
	          should be handled by local hospital chief executives in consultation with 
	          their own clinicians, who all have a direct interest in delivering IT that 
	          works. Local hospitals should have freedom to buy from a wide range of 
	          suppliers whose technology conforms to national standards. Functions such as 
	          setting common standards could be transferred to the Department of Health. 
	          There is no need for an expensive separate agency&#8221;.</b></p>
	        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;This is a truly grim tale. 
	          The NHS IT programme has already cost over £2 billion, with five times more 
	          than that in the pipeline, and yet the programme is unlikely to deliver 
	          significant clinical benefits by the end of the contract.&nbsp; There have been 
	          six bosses in five years.&nbsp; The programme has left doctors, nurses and 
	          hospital managers spitting with rage.&nbsp; Most GPs think the appointment 
	          booking system is a joke.&nbsp; And three fifths of the programme is dependent on 
	          a software supplier, iSoft, which is under investigation by the Financial 
	          Services Authority and whose flagship software product, &#8216;Lorenzo&#8217;, does not 
	          yet exist even though the company said it was available three years ago, and 
	          which in the meantime has been merrily selling old software which pre-dates 
	          the national programme. You just couldn&#8217;t make this up&#8221;.</b></p>
	        <p class="newsbody"><b>&nbsp;&#8220;The limited deployment of 
	          administrative systems which has taken place so far has caused havoc in 
	          various hospitals, leading to significant delays in providing inoculations 
	          to children, waiting list breaches, missing patient records, extended shut 
	          downs of some systems and the inability to report activity statistics&#8221;. </b></p>
	        <p class="newsbody"><b>&#8220;The central problem arises 
	          from a set of huge contracts which were signed in great haste, before either 
	          the government had understood properly what it wanted to buy or the 
	          suppliers had understood what it was they were expected to supply.&nbsp; It is 
	          impossible to avoid the conclusion that this project has been an expensive 
	          failure. It will continue to fail unless there are drastic changes&#8221;.</b></p>
	        <p class="newsbody">The report calls on the 
	          Department of Health to commission and publish an independent assessment of 
	          the business case for the Programme in the light of the progress and 
	          experience to date. </p>
	        <p class="newsbody">In view of the slippage in 
	          the deployment of local systems, the MPs also recommend that the Department 
	          of Health should commission an urgent independent review of the performance 
	          of Local Service Providers against their contractual obligations.</p>

                clinical benefits and which were the core of the business case for the 

                high cost contracts, may scarcely have begun by the time the Local

                exist. By now almost all acute hospital Trusts should have new NPfIT 
                patient administration systems (PAS) as the essential first step in the 
                introduction of the local Care Record Service. As of June 2006 the 
                actual number was 13 hospitals. In June 2006 the Department wrote to us 
                stating that by October 2006 there would be a further twenty-two. So far 
                as we are aware, up to the end of February 2007 the number has increased 
                by only five acute hospitals. The introduction of clinical as opposed to
