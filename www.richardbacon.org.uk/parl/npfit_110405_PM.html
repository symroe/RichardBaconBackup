   SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has written to  Prime Minister David Cameron, asking him to use his good offices to ensure  a sensible outcome in contract renegotiations between computer firm CSC and the NHS under the controversial National Programme for IT in the NHS.</p>

      <p class="edirots"><a name="110405_DC"></a>Rt Hon David Cameron MP<br>
      Prime Minister<br>
      10 Downing Street<br>
      London SW1A 0AA</p>
      <p class="edirots">5 April 2011</p>
      <p class="edirots">Dear Prime Minister</p>
      <p class="edirots"><strong>CABINET OFFICE  INVOLVEMENT IN DISPUTES WITH NHS IT SUPPLIERS </strong></p>
      <p class="edirots">I am writing to you about  current negotiations with CSC under the National Programme for IT in the NHS,  because I believe you should insist that Connecting for Health accepts the need  for full and unhampered Cabinet Office involvement in the renegotiation process.</p>
      <p class="edirots">The NPfIT contracts with  service providers are fundamentally broken. There really is no good public  policy justification for continuing them, since the Local Service Providers  (LSPs) have manifestly failed to deliver what was expected of them.&nbsp; However,  the terms of the contracts seem to raise a significant threat of legal action  if the government were now to withdraw from them unilaterally. The government  is now exploring how it might minimise that risk, or at least maximise the  chances of winning any legal action that is taken. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="edirots">The Efficiency &amp;  Reform Group in the Cabinet Office have rightly taken the view that – as with  other government IT suppliers – the National Programme LSP contracts should be  set within the wider sphere of government computing and the overall  relationship which suppliers are seeking to have with the Crown.&nbsp; &nbsp;It  should give the LSPs pause for thought if any legal action they might take  could put them in dispute with the entire UK public sector and not simply the  NHS.&nbsp; Any IT supplier with significant government contracts or ambitions  to enter into them in future would have to take that into serious  account.&nbsp; In this context, it is worth stating that Fujitsu is taking a  very constructive approach to its overall relationship with government.</p>
      <p class="edirots">However, I remain very  concerned about CSC and I fear that the approach adopted by the Chief  Information Officer for Health may not be helping the situation.&nbsp; Connecting  for Health seems to remain committed to the delivery of systems through Local Service Providers such as CSC that have been  shown to be unreliable, subject to serious delays and, even after contract  renegotiations, unreasonably expensive. Furthermore, CSC’s  offer to extend its contract and then to offer a choice of software instead  will not help;&nbsp; even with the proposed reduction from 220 to 80 Trusts,  this would cause serious problems, which I would summarise as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="edirots">CSC have been proven  to be very expensive and also very bad at deploying timely and efficient  systems in the NHS; </li><BR>

        <li class="edirots">The Government has  rightly signalled the need to return to a free market for NHS IT solutions,  where hospitals can choose the best systems from the best suppliers, and poor  suppliers like CSC will have to up their game if they want to win business;</li><br>
        <li class="edirots">Allowing CSC to deploy  whatever systems they choose, to 80 sites or more, would be a major distortion  of the marketplace, without any compensating gains. Many Trusts would feel  obliged to opt for CSC systems because they would be “free” to them; other  suppliers would be unable to compete. </li><br>
        <li class="edirots">This situation would  get even worse if, as reported, iSoft is bought out by CSC.&nbsp; Monopoly  providers are often a problem; incompetent monopoly providers are always a  problem. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="edirots">I am also convinced that  once central milestone payments are taken into account, CSC (and also BT) are  charging the NHS a great deal more for each system than would be charged by  normal (i.e. non-Local Service Provider) suppliers.&nbsp; Constant amendments  to LSP contracts to give the suppliers more time, more options, and more  product opportunities simply mean that the NHS is landing itself with more  serious and avoidable problems.&nbsp; It should be remembered that over the  last seven years the NHS has accepted old systems that <em>predate</em> the  National Programme – supposedly as a short term interim solution when the  timetable for the Lorenzo system first slipped – and it has tolerated delay  after delay as deadlines were missed.&nbsp; The NHS has spent tens or even  hundreds of millions of pounds of its own money on Lorenzo, trying to install  the frankly uninstallable. </p>
      <p class="edirots">I therefore believe that  any settlement with existing Local Service Providers must be separated  decisively from any consideration of future NHS business. &nbsp;In other words,  CSC (and in my opinion also BT) must be made to compete in an open market as  best they can.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="edirots">I believe the time is  right for you to use your good offices to ensure a sensible outcome to the  contract renegotiation with CSC.</p>

          <p class="edirots">2nd  March 2011</p>
          <p class="edirots">Dear  Ms Connelly</p>
          <p class="edirots"><strong>CONTRACT NEGOTIATION IN THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR IT IN THE NHS</strong></p>
          <p class="edirots">Thank you very much for your letter of 24th January 2011. </p>
          <p class="edirots">In my original letter to you of 13th January 2011, I asked  you specifically whether the contract renegotiations with BT and Cerner  represented best value for taxpayers’ money.&nbsp; Although I am grateful for  your detailed reply, I do not see any direct answer to that question, which  seems to me absolutely fundamental.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="edirots">Unless the question can be answered clearly in the affirmative, I can  see no justification for concluding further agreements with these companies, at  least until after the NAO has reported and the Public Accounts Committee has  had time to consider its findings. I am disappointed that you have not given  such a commitment and I would ask you again to consider doing so.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="edirots">I would also like to address some of the specific points in your  letter. </p>
          <p class="edirots">My  point about the Cerner product in London was that originally planned  deployments of GP systems, a London Ambulance solution and a number of systems  in acute trusts were included in the original contract price of £1.2 billion <strong><em>and  are not now being delivered</em></strong>.&nbsp; I note that you do not comment on my  observation that only about half the original contract will be delivered, but  that payments have been reduced by only £112 million.&nbsp; I cannot see how  this can be value for money to taxpayers and I note that you do not claim that  it is.</p>
          <p class="edirots">You say that I am “misinformed” about the level of Cerner  functionality, which you say “has not been reduced”.&nbsp; I must refer you to  page 23 of the June 2006 NAO report in which it is stated that Cerner  Millennium was being supplied in four releases, covering the same functionality  as the original five IDX releases. This included a Patient Administration  System, a GP system, a web based referrer, a pharmacy system, and systems for  acute departments, emergency care and mental health, all to be delivered as an  integrated Cerner solution. Much of this has now been dropped, or replaced with  cheaper departmental systems such as RiO, but I cannot see that taxpayers have  seen an appropriate consequent saving.</p>
          <p class="edirots">You acknowledge that the history of delivery of Lorenzo is “very  unsatisfactory”, a point on which we can certainly agree. My additional point  is that there is no good reason to think that the long record of unmet  promises, missed deadlines and in some cases outright misrepresentation is  about to change. Therefore, I can see no good reason for the Department to  persist with supporting the deployment of the Lorenzo system through the  contract with CSC. I note that the Chief Executive of the NHS and the President  of CSC were scheduled to meet to discuss this matter and I sincerely hope that  this does not simply result in further unreliable promises and consequent  failures. </p>
          <p class="edirots">In relation to the price of the RiO product, I would observe that the  systems supplied directly by CSE Servelec seem to be functioning in practice as  well as the LSP version, so I cannot see how there is a good reason for the  price of the LSP versions to be around ten times as high. As you say, this is  likely to be considered by the NAO. In the interim, I should be happy to supply  a list of non-NPfIT RiO users if that would assist you in making the  comparison. My concern about value for money to taxpayers is of course not  related to whether the decision was made entirely by your Department or with  some involvement by the Treasury. </p>
          <p class="edirots">Since my letter to you there have been further reports that raise  doubts over the effectiveness of LSP systems, including:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li class="edirots">serious       under-use of Lorenzo at NHS Bury; </li>
            <li class="edirots">a       failure to go live with Lorenzo at Pennine Care NHS Trust; and </li>
            <li class="edirots">a       call for compensation by North Bristol NHS Trust for late delivery of a       PAS system. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="edirots">These reports simply add to my concern that you seem to remain  committed to the delivery of systems through LSPs that have been shown to be  unreliable, subject to serious delays and, even after contract renegotiations,  unreasonably expensive. Quite apart from the burden this places on taxpayers at  a time of exception stringency in public spending, it is also surely not in the  interests of the NHS and its patients. </p>
          <p class="edirots">I do sincerely hope that you will now feel able to give a commitment  not to enter into revised contracts until the NAO has reported and the PAC has  considered the matter. </p>
          <p class="edirots">Yours sincerely<br>
