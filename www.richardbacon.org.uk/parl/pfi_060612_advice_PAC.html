      <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"><span style="text-transform: uppercase"><br></span>SOUTH NORFOLK MP Richard Bacon has called for public sector clients in PFI projects to get access to expert advice early on, so that project teams can get a more realistic idea of the likely costs before the project goes out to tender.
      <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left:0pt; text-autospace: none"> Mr Bacon was speaking after Mr Jack Pringle, President of the Royal Institute of 
        Architects (RIBA), was invited to give evidence at the Commons public accounts 
        committee hearing on the collapse of the Paddington Health Campus scheme. <br>
        Mr Pringle informed the committee that public sector clients were 
        generally inexperienced and that they would benefit from professional 
        support.&nbsp;   
      <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">You can read the uncorrected transcript of Mr Bacon&#8217;s questions to Mr Pringle <a class="tsb" href="#transcript">here</a>. </p>
      <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none">Mr Bacon, a member of the committee, said:<b> &#8220;Under PFI, public sector clients are often thrown in at the deep end, with minimal experience on how to manage the complexities of huge capital projects, like the building of a hospital&#8221;. </b></p>
      <p class="newsbody" style="text-autospace: none"><b>&#8220;Early advice from bodies like RIBA can put public sector clients on a much firmer footing.  The better informed the client is, the better the outcome is likely to be.  This can make all the difference later in the project and I welcome RIBA&#8217;s involvement in providing such advice&#8221;. </b></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier"> <a name="transcript"></a>Q39 Mr Bacon: </span></b> <span style="font-family:Courier">Mr Pringle, as the President of 
          the Royal Institute of British Architects, we can safely assume you 
          study projects and project failure probably more closely than most. 
          This particular project seems to have such a large number of risks 
          which were basically ignored. What do you think could have been done 
          to have minimised the risk?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: A number of things could have been done and a lot of them 
          are obviously identified in the report, such as the client structure 
          and the management structure. I should not like to focus on those. I 
          should like to look at some of the areas that we have been looking 
          at more generally to do with PFI. Although it is said in the report 
          that as this project did not reach PFI bidding stage there are no 
          implications for PFI, that is not actually the case, because the 
          run-up to the project, the building of the brief et cetera and the 
          outline business case is predicated on a PFI model. So you have to 
          look at it in the round and one of the things that we are observing 
          generally and which this might be an example of is one of the 
          failures or the weaknesses of PFI, though there are plenty of 
          strengths of PFI and we are not knocking the system entirely. You 
          have a system in PFI where it is assumed that virtually all of the 
          design is going to be done by the PFI consortia and so design is 
          pretty much abstracted from the client side of the equation. We are 
          seeing that briefs which need to be tested by looking at early 
          designs, whether this will work for us in this way, whether there is 
          not a better way of doing it, briefs which could be tested by 
          affordability if an outline design were done at an earlier stage, 
          briefs which could be tested for their suitability to a site, even 
          getting an outline planning permission, is not being done in PFI 
          projects to their detriment.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q40 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">Are you 
            basically saying there is something in the nature of the process 
            itself that actually inhibits the preparation of a robust outline 
            business case?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: Yes. At the moment the PFI mechanism does inhibit initial 
          design exemplars being done to the site and we believe that these 
          could be done to the benefit of that. Indeed the Treasury now 
          believes that this is the case and the latest advice from the 
          Treasury is that more upfront designs should be done in order to 
          develop the briefs, test the briefs and to minimise the risks; 
          minimise the risk to the whole project, minimise the risk to the 
          bidding consortia.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q41 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">There is 
            something inherently odd, is there not, in going off to a potential 
            provider and asking them to build a hospital without yourself having 
            a fairly good idea, at least in outline, of what it is that you are 
            wanting back in terms of what it does. Not necessarily what it looks 
            like in terms of the material used to construct the cladding on the 
            outside but what it looks like in terms of roughly the space it 
            occupies, roughly its size and to a fair degree of specificity what 
            it is you want; effectively a design brief.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: That is absolutely right. The more design that can be done 
          up front, the better prepared the project is to go to the market as 
          well as also dialling out some of those risks that this project 
          seems to have tripped up on.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q42 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">I should like to 
            ask you about costs, because the putative costs obviously went up 
            significantly on this project and we have seen that on many 
            projects; famously on the Scottish Parliament, on Portcullis House 
            across the road and on a number of other projects, some of which 
            were notorious and dragged on for many years. In the case of the 
            Scottish Parliament, I always wondered, having looked at lots of 
            other projects, how anyone thought that &pound;40 million would be an 
            adequate sum and &pound;400 million sounded roughly more in the ballpark 
            of what it might end up being, which of course it did. Is it the 
            case that we are actually looking at spiralling costs or is it that 
            we are looking at inadequate information about what the real true 
            costs are?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: It would be wise not to get into the Scottish Parliament.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q43 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">No; no. 
            Especially with Mr Davidson here. The point is, is it simply that 
            they really spiralled, is it that the costs really shot up through 
            the roof or is it really that a better and fuller understanding of 
            what the costs, and those costs always had been as such, actually 
            were?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: It is our belief that some of those initial bids were 
          completely unrealistic, as the costs revealed themselves at a later 
          stage when they were properly analysed. That is not to say that some 
          costs do not get out of control as additional requirements are put 
          into projects and there are then the issues of change control. If 
          you stuck to the single point, testing the consequences of the 
          brief, in other words what any particular client in the public 
          sector wants from the buildings, can be most effectively done when 
          an outline design is done at an early stage. You can actually see 
          the consequences, the physical and the spatial consequences, how it 
          is going to have to fit on a site, whether there are transportation 
          issues et cetera, et cetera. Those can then be costed in the most 
          direct way and it is not being done in an abstract way and a cost 
          per bed way. The case, in terms of controlling costs, is well made 
          for an outline design at an early stage.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q44 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">I visited the 
            Belfast City Cancer Hospital where what they call the exemplar 
            approach was adopted and the early project design phase from the 
            client side was led by an architect working with a range of 
            different professionals who knew before they went out to bid that it 
            would cost &pound;48.2 million and that is more or less exactly what it 
            cost. Is it actually the case that you can take an example like that 
            and read it across to any kind of project or were there things which 
            were special about Belfast that made it possible there, but which 
            would not be possible elsewhere?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: The Belfast example you give is a good pilot of the 
          proposals that we are putting forward for PFI generally and yes, you 
          can pretty much read it across. It is a good example of the sort of 
          certainty that you can get in almost any type of project if you do 
          that much more work up front. </span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q45 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">In your note to 
            the Committee you talk about better resourced clients and one of the 
            points you make, and I quote, is &quot;Too often, at the moment, the 
            public sector gatekeepers are inexperienced and under-supported in 
            terms of professional, expert advice&quot;. Would not somebody in 
            response to that say &quot;Well that is the whole point of having a bid 
            process constructed around PFI, because you have professional expert 
            advice available and it is available to the PFI bidders&quot;?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: No, it does not quite work like that. They are indeed 
          expert; in fact there is an inequality of expertise on the client 
          and the PFI consortia bidders' side. Public sector clients are 
          generally inexperienced and that is not to say they are 
          unintelligent, it is just that there has not been a lot of public 
          sector work going around for the last 30 years and now there is a 
          huge amount of it suddenly on the scene. What we regularly find is 
          that good clients, well-structured, regularly get good projects and 
          public sector clients who are suddenly thrown into building projects 
          which they are not used to, often really struggle to manage the 
          complexities of these huge new capital projects which they are 
          landed with. That is another good reason for getting a really 
          comprehensive professional team on the client side to advise them on 
          their side of the consortium, PFI, contract on how they should be 
          proceeding, how they should be structuring their ideas, how they 
          should be structuring their approach to the whole thing. Their 
          inexperience needs support. One of the things we have done at the 
          RIBA is set a complete group of people up to do exactly that, to 
          give help, not to go in and be designers, just to help clients think 
          their way through these sorts of problems.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q46 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">We have seen in 
            the Ministry of Defence that smart acquisition at least aims to 
            spend more in the assessment phase early on whereby, effectively 
            before they get a long way into the manufacturing or the design 
            phase, they have a better idea of where it is they are going. Is 
            there an analogy that can apply or a comparison that can usefully be 
            applied between smart acquisition for weapon systems in the MoD and 
            smart procurement generally?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: It is the same thing. It does not matter what sort of 
          project you are doing: the better your preparation before you enter 
          into the real thick of the project, the better your outcome is going 
          to be. Again, that is what we are recommending. </span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q47 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">One thing I 
            really do not understand about this is the land issue. Common sense 
            would suggest that something as central as the land issue must be 
            sorted out very early on. How do you think that something so central 
            as land in this could only be identified so late in the day?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: Two reasons have brought that about from my reading of the 
          papers. One is the change in the brief requirements with the 
          alteration to the brief both from consumerism, which ups the space 
          standards per bed, and other changes to the brief. A bigger hospital 
          was required and then, as I understand it, the understanding of the 
          local authority's height requirements capped the limits of the 
          available site to contain a particular project and so they 
          essentially ran out of road, ran out of land.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><span style="font-family:Courier">Q48 Mr 
          Bacon: </span></b><span style="font-family:Courier">Do you think, if 
            an approach such as you are recommending had been adopted, that this 
            land issue could have been either solved or flagged up for the 
            significant issue that it was to a greater extent earlier on?</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Mr 
          Pringle: Well I would like to think so, because what we are 
          advocating is better scrutiny of the brief, better development of 
          the brief, better signing off of the brief and of course if you are 
          doing early design work, you can very naturally test the capacity of 
          the land and you can talk with the local authority and you can even 
          obtain your outline planning permission at that stage.</span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family:Courier">Chairman: 
          Thank you Mr Pringle. It is very helpful to have an independent 
          voice.</span></font></p>
