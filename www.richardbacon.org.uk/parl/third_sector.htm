		  <p class="newsbody" style="MARGIN-LEFT:0pt">COMMENTING ON the publication of the Commons public accounts committee&#8217;s report on building the capacity of the third sector, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said: 
	      <p class="newsbody" style="margin-left: 0pt"><b> &#8220;The ChangeUp programme was an &pound;80 million shot in the dark 
		      that failed to follow even the most basic rules of project management&#8221;.&nbsp; </b>

			<p class="newsbody"><b>
			<br>
			&#8220;The ChangeUp 
			programme was an £80 million shot in the dark that failed to follow 
			even the most basic rules of project management.&nbsp; The scheme had no 
			targets against which to measure achievement and third sector bodies 
			may well have been able to get funding from somewhere else&#8221;.&nbsp; </span>
			</font></b></p>
			<p class="newsbody"><b>
			&#8220;Delays in getting 
			ChangeUp off the ground caused the Home Office to squeeze its 
			planned three-year spend of £80 million into 21 months. &nbsp;Third 
			sector bodies were then given too much money and were forced to 
			spend it too quickly.&nbsp; If the Home Office had listened to their 
			pleas for more time, then third sector bodies would have been able 
			to spend their funding more wisely, upset fewer people and made a 
			greater and more sustainable impact.&nbsp; Instead, money was being spent 
			on activities simply because it had to be spent in a given 
			timeframe&#8221;.&nbsp; </span></font></b></p>
			<p class="newsbody"><b>
			&#8220;It is scandalous 
			that this sort of attitude should persist in the 21<sup>st</sup> 
			century.&nbsp; Public money should never be squandered in this way&#8221;.</span></font></b></p>
			<p class="newsbody">
			Mr Bacon was speaking as the Commons 
			public accounts committee published its report on building the 
			capacity of the third sector.&nbsp; The third sector includes voluntary and 
			community organisations, charities and social enterprises, ranging 
			from small local community groups to large established national and 
			international organisations. The Government&#8217;s objective in working 
			with these organisations is to strengthen communities, improve 
			public services, encourage social enterprise and support the 
			conditions for the third sector to thrive.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
			<p class="newsbody">
			In 2004 the Home Office introduced two 
			programmes to build the capacity of the third sector to contribute 
			to the delivery of public services.&nbsp; &#8216;ChangeUp&#8217; gives funding to 
			regional and local support providers to form &#8216;consortia&#8217; to provide 
			services to make frontline organisations more effective. 
			&#8216;Futurebuilders&#8217; is a £215 million investment fund that invests 
			directly in frontline third sector organisations that would 
			otherwise not have access to commercial sources of finance and 
			enables them to build their capacity and bid for public service 
			delivery contracts. These programmes are now the responsibility of 
			the Office of the Third Sector, which is part of the Cabinet Office. 
			Together the programmes will cost almost £450 million to 2011.&nbsp;
			</span></font></p>
			<p class="newsbody">
			The report finds that the design of 
			the ChangeUp programme was complex and took longer than planned, 
			leading to less time than intended for consortia to spend the 
			initial funding of £80 million. &nbsp;The period for which funding is 
			given to organisations can affect the ability of those organisations 
			to use it fruitfully.&nbsp; The lack of a planned evaluation of ChangeUp 
			is a major failing, and is particularly alarming given the inherent 
			risks in the programme, its untested approach, complex delivery 
			mechanism, and devolved decision-making arrangements. </span></font>
